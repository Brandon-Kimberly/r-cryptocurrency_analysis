Before you get too caught up in chasing the charts and the latest moon shot, you should consider the competition you are up against.\n\nShort term investing is a game of poker.  Here is my rough tier list of your competition at the table:\n\n1. **Exchanges and Brokers** \\- The only guaranteed winners in the market.  They will take 0.1-5% of every trade, win or lose.  They also have huge access to the trends and decisions everybody is making, which can be used to bet against you.\n2. **Governments** \\- Just because crypto can be \"decentralized\" does not mean you are free from paying taxes and following regulations.  Expect to pay a big chunk of each winning hand to these guys.  While the rules vary country to country, you will likely pay them a much larger chunk for your short term gains than you would for a long term investment.\n3. **Illegal Traders (Insider Trading, Pump and Dump groups, etc.)** \\- These guys have very strong knowledge of the market, and are pretty much guaranteed to take your money if you play the wrong hand.\n4. **Whales** \\- These guys have massive influence over the game, and they can swing the market to their favor as needed.  Unlike you, they can afford to take short term losses repeatedly, as their influence will eventually net them gains no matter what.\n5. **Trading Bots** \\- Evaluate charts, social media trends, and various other resources to make programmed decisions about the market.  By the time you've read a positive news article on your favorite crypto, thousands of these guys have already made trades based on their expectations of its impact.\n6. **Professional Day Traders** \\- These guys are working with all of the above resources to make decisions.  Their full time job is to find ways to take your money.\n7. **Amateur Day Traders** \\- You.  Bottom of the food chain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, the odds are stacked heavily against you in every way possible.  Your chances of winning the game their way are slim to none.  Studies show that over 80% of day traders end up losing money.\n\nSo how do you win?\n\n**Time.** You may have heard the saying \"Time in the market beats timing the market\".  When zoomed out to a few years on the charts, market growth is positive and your hand is winning! Long term taxes are smaller as well.  So stop worrying about chasing the peaks and valleys! Do some research on long-term strategies and relax!\n\nThis is not financial advice, just my perspective of the market.

If Bitcoin goes up, the market goes up. If Bitcoin crashes, then everything crashes. This is pretty much common knowledge, but I have encountered quite a few people lately that are new to crypto and did not know this and occasionally they even wonder how is that even possible that the entire market suddenly drops, all at the same time, following the exact same curve? It must be a scam and all manipulated because no way this is a \u201cnatural\u201d occurrence. But actually, it is. \n\nThe below is a rough explanation of one of the reasons, amongst many, why this happens. There are other reasons too, some may affect it more some may affect it less, but this one gives a good idea about why it is a logical consequence of Bitcoin pulling the market so that it is not caused by some unknown Great Manipulator in the shadows, but it is a natural phenomenon.\n\nIt is all basically happening because there is a trading pair (BTC/USDT) that have both its coins traded with most other coins, like when there is a new coin added to exchanges it is very likely it will be set up as trading pairs with Bitcoin and USDT so by now, there are trading pairs on most exchanges between any coins and Bitcoin (BTC) and any coins and Tether (USDT). This means you can trade your coins for Bitcoin and for USDT amongst others. So if there is a sharp move on the BTC/USDT pair, it imbalances the price of other coins that also trade between both coins, generating a pressure to follow.\n\nSo first, let\u2019s assume we have 1 Bitcoin (BTC), 1 Tether (USDT) and 1 Tabby Cat Token (TCT). They all have trading pairs with each other, so there are BTC/USDT, BTC/TCT and also USDT/TCT pairs.\n\nFor simplicity, let\u2019s assume 1BTC=1USDT=1TCT meaning you can buy 1 Bitcoin for 1 USDT or 1USDT for 1TCT or 1 Bitcoin for 1TCT. This is the balance state.\n\nIf Bitcoin drops to half of its value against USDT because someone sells a large amount of it for USDT pushing down the price, it is easy to see that suddenly the TCT/BTC and TCT/USDT price will become imbalanced. Before the deal it was 1TCT=1BTC and 1TCT=1USDT but when Bitcoin dropped to half its price against USDT it created a market price pressure on TCT since at that point 1TCT did worth 1USDT but also did worth 1BTC directly but 2BTC indirectly through USDT. So indirectly TCT went up against Bitcoin resulting in sell orders driving the price of TCT down too following the price of Bitcoin.\n\nSince the above happens quickly, pretty much in real time, all we can see is that when Bitcoin moves, most of the market also moves with it. \n\nOf course, this is just one of the reasons, probably not even explained very well or accurately, but I find it simple enough to make some sense in the \u201ceverything moves together\u201d events so some people may sleep better when they understand that it is just a logical consequence of the aligned stars (Bitcoin and USDT) and not an elaborate market manipulation of some major scammer."}, {"title": "Are Musk and Taleb testing us?", "score": 7, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mz2jrs/are_musk_and_taleb_testing_us/", "selftext": "Just a simple thought.

When the crash came, I saw my portfolio go from profits to -75% of my initial investment. Here's how I dealt with it and came back into the green in 2021.\n\nI am sharing my story because the same situation might happen to many newcomers when a crash comes (and it will). Don't fool yourselves, BTC will not reach 500k just like that. We might enter another 3 years of bear market that will result in:\n- People selling at loss\n- Loss of public interest for cryptocurrency \n- Enforcement of the \"Bitcoin is a scam\" mentality\n- A lot of people losing money\n\nSo here are a few tips I learned and gathered through the years which helped me get back into the green:\n\n1. \"You haven't loss anything until you sell\". I read this advice here on r/cryptocurrency and it really stuck with me. Even if you bought at ATH and are now facing losses, you shouldn't neglect the possibility of your investment becoming profitable once again during a future bullrun. Some of my assets took 3 years to get back into the green but still ended up being more profitable than if I had placed that money in the bank for the same amount of time.\n\n2. Invest MAINLY in projects you believe in and keep the \"get rich quick\" ones to a minimum. This was one of my biggest mistakes. I was seeing shitcoins take massive gains in days while my favourite projects were stagnant and FOMO got the best of me. I ended up losing A LOT in coins that were overhyped and never recovered from the crash. Don't be fooled by high % gains, they don't mean anything when a crash comes and your quick earned profit disappears never to be seen again.\n\n3. Don't be afraid to reorganize your portfolio even if you're in the negative. When I was down 75% from my initial investment, I started feeling like my money was already lost and didn't mind taking \"risks\" with it. I sold some assets I didn't believe in anymore and used that money to buy more of the ones I still believed in. That allowed me to buy my favourite coins at crazy low prices without injecting more fiat. That alone brought me back in the positive in 2021.\n\n4. TAKE SOME PROFIT OUT. I understand a lot of us are hoping for life changing gains and live by the hodl mentality. But one thing I learned in crypto is: sooner or later prices will go down. Having profits ready to be used when a crash comes is what will save your initial investment. Don't be afraid to set some profit aside in stable coins ready to buy a TRUE dip. Not a -15% but one that would bring your portfolio value to almost nothing. Knowing you have some profits ready to save your ass when a crash comes will make dips easier on your sanity and future bull runs much more profitable.\n\n5. Be patient. If you really believe in cryptocurrency and believe this is just the beginning, don't let dips and crashes get the best of you. BTC went from a 20k ATH to 5k in 2017-2018 only to come back to 60k in 2021. \n\nOnce again, keep in mind that bull runs make us all too confident. It's easy to joke about hodling through the storms but it won't be once they come for real. Be ready and rational when it happens."}, {"title": "Beware of the FUD...", "score": 3, "url": "https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/bitcoin-market-liquidity-recover-btc-price-crash-futures-derivatives-jpmorgan-2021-4-1030344438", "selftext": ""}, {"title": "How Does Taxes Work When It Comes To Crypto?", "score": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mz1a4s/how_does_taxes_work_when_it_comes_to_crypto/", "selftext": "Note: I'm In The US Guys, NYC Specifically\n\n\nGood afternoon everyone. \n\nI'm new to the crypto world and I just wanted to know if anyone knows the ins and outs of how is crypto taxed?

There was a rapid and short fall in price to $47,000.00 yesterday. This triggered buying ( most likely limit orders). That just as fast pushed up the price.

It is one that I've found especially difficult in the crypto realm. As a relatively new investor, I found it difficult to push my ego to the side and acknowledge my shortcomings which were holding me back from profitability. Maybe it was the constant reminders of individuals banking 1000x returns, maybe it was the allure of the gamble, or maybe it was something else entirely, but for my first 90 days in the market, I was completely incapable of admitting I was making every mistake that more experienced traders warn about here; constantly shifting funds to chase the hyped coin, buying into shitcoins 3/4 through a pump, failing to do thorough research on positions before entering, and the list goes on.\n\nI have finally broken away from that ego that was holding me back for so long in this realm, and wanted to share the reflections that brought me into profitability so other new crypto investors might read this post and avoid the stage of unnecessary losses or losing hope in the crypto space all together.\n\n\\*\\*Key Lessons Learned\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*1.) Get Rid of Your Ego\\*\\*\n\nCrypto is not the realm to believe that you have what it takes to figure out everything on your own. This market will chew you up and spit you back out with a completely empty wallet before you can say \"get rich quick\". Listen to the more experienced members of the community, there is a reason they have lasted as long as they have or seen the profits that they have.\n\n\\*\\*2.) Record Everything\\*\\*\n\nIt's extremely easy to lie to yourself when your sights are set on the massive returns of some obscure coin that social media influencers will swear is going to the moon. Your memory is short and only becomes shorter the more common longshot opportunities become for you. Record every dollar, coin, transaction, trade, etc. that you make and keep an accurate profit and loss spreadsheet. With an abundance of separate wallets, exchanges, networks, smart chains, etc., the details can become lost in the whirlwind. Take a step back and create a ledger in which you can monitor your overall profitability. Analyzing this is the best way to \"plug holes\" in your strategy, realize your biggest mistakes, and keep yourself motivated when you finally see that P/L rise.\n\n\\*\\*3.) Be Honest, Be Patient\\*\\*\n\nThis last lesson was the result of my combination of the first two methods. After losing a significant amount chasing moonshots and quick gains, I found myself internally refusing to admit how much I was losing due to being impatient. After applying the first two lessons, I was unable to avoid this final truth, being patient and trusting in your fundamentals is the only way to get to your destination in crypto. Bitcoin didn't hit 50k overnight, and neither will the new alt you invested in last week. If you believe in a project / coin / investment, give it the time it needs to grow.\n\n\\*\\*In Summary\\*\\*\n\nI know many of you will not have faced these problems as I did, but I wrote this partly as a reminder to myself, and partly in the hopes that my experience will save someone the months of difficulty I faced in coming to these realizations."}, {"title": "\"Influencers\" whom promote certain Sh*tcoins are cut from the same cloth as \"Influencers\" that promote gambling to children.

These skins can be freely traded and have real $ value, in certain cases up to MILLIONS of USD, yes millions.

It took the masses forever to grasp what's going and regulators took even longer to step in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't have to explain to people using this sub how certain individuals are tainting the beauty of blockchain technology for a quick cashgrab by creating some sh'itcoin+insane marketing.

Remember in the early days where in order to use the internet you could not be on the phone? Remember how expensive it was? I'm sure there were geezer and bootlickers proclaiming that the internet was a failure and it would never catch on because it was slow, expensive, and inconvenient. Well fast forward and the internet is basically our lifeblood. \n\nOh and about that price volitilty, remember when America took the dollar off the gold standard and we had massive inflation in the 70s? Well that's because it became a brand new currency, and brand new currencies are volitile. Eventually though, once it reaches a certain point of adoption, that volitilty stops being a problem. \n\nMeanwhile many many paper currencies are losing that stability, with USD (and I know no one wants to believe it) not too far from that point, though it will probably be the last fiat standing due to it's reserve status. Unlike bitcoin though, it isn't a digital technology, it is an archaic, corrupted technology that will take way too long to change, and that immediately makes bitcoin far superior to fiat. \n\nI'm seeing the fud here and other places. I see these people look at this brand new technology see it's problems and decide (for some reason) that it will always be like this therefore it's a failure and a ponzi(??? Why?? Do you even know what a ponzi is? A ponzi is robbing peter to pay paul, bitcoin doesn't have an owner so it by definition cannot be a ponzi. If I buy bitcoin I have physical proof that I own that asset. So I'm not being robbed, so it isn't a ponzi). \n\nBitcoin will grow and it will evolve and it will get the current problems fixed. That's how digital technology works. Just be patient. These things take time, that's why it's called an investment. As a proof of concept, bitcoin absolutely works. We have plenty of projects in the works to tweak the network so that it eventually becomes faster and we're getting the adoption, it has the network effect already, so it only needs time.

It just needs to be better than the alternative. And it IS. Also I'm not a bitcoin maximalist.

At the up, it\u2019s the maximum price people are willing to pay. At the down, it\u2019s at the price where people cannot resist.\n\nThere are many ways to draw resistance levels and indeed some have reached a level of arcane art that deserves appreciation if not adherence. Lines, pillars and colors attempt to map out what has gone before, give it meaning, and apply it to the future.\n\nThe tools of this trade have become increasingly convoluted over the years, as with astrology or palm reading, due to the sheer number of adjustments that must be made. Confirmation bias needs a foundation, after all. And with the complexity has come that saddest of things: little questioned acceptance.\n\nQuantitive analysis has its value. In the 1980s it closed a significant number of market inefficiencies, exposed clearly by numbers, yet missed to that date by the old breed of emotive traders. But since that period it has had a more troubled life.\n\nAnd that is troubling in itself.\n\nIt is one thing to begin a numerical analysis of a field and to discover inefficiencies as they exist. It is quite another to tell the future based on the past, particularly when that future compounds complexity each minute further out you look. \n\nThe issue that marks the delineation between the point where quantitive analysis can provide relative certainly and where it cannot is time. For each second that passes, millions of trades occur, and move in lockstep with thousands of new data points from the market. Earnings. Pauses. Contracts.\n\nThere is a concept in statistical analysis that has thrown national security programs as much as trading performance relates to false negatives and false positives. The more data you have, the more of these you. The more of these you have, the less reliable your conclusions.\n\nAnd back to resistance levels we come.\n\nIf you explore the recent history of quantitive analysis you will note that it tends to have more success in high frequency trading than in longer (let\u2019s call them normal) positions. This is mathematics at work. Your complexity at 100ms is exponentially smaller than at 1 second, let alone 10. \n\nWhen you pull back further, and try to call a day or a week or a month, the realm starts to shift from science to magic. It\u2019s possible to be correct, of course, but it\u2019s possible to be the opposite. And undue confidence may come from making a call that only has two answers: up or down. It\u2019s hard to tell if a wall of mathematical runes or a toss of a coin provides more utility.\n\nA resistance level is a judgement call based on observed behavior from the asset and investors in an asset. It is based on past behavior and a slice of the current, and this it offers certainty only if all variables remain the same as they were at the points of initial measurement. \n\nResistance levels do have utility. If an asset keeps bouncing between 1.20 and 1.50, it is a reasonable call to say \u201cit seems to bounce between 1.20 and 1.50 but not above or below.\u201d And it is also reasonable to say \u201cit is at 1.20 now so it may move upward again.\u201d And so on.\n\nThis is about as far as resistance levels go. If it passes 1.50 the asset may have suddenly become popular on its merits, or because people turned to dislike against something else. If it drops to 1.10 there may be a crisis of confidence, or just something more shiny in the market.\n\nInitial guesses on pricing movement have a certain respectability that secondary guesses, based on a second if, seldom have. Arcane runes aside, one might find oneself equally well-briefed by picking up the Wall Street Journal or the Financial Times and checking the headlines.\n\nWell, dear reader, there we leave it. Apply the words above as you see fit, from with interest through to distain, and all the stances in between.

How many unsuccessful trades are these guys not showing you?\n\nRecent examples include Doge and SAFEMOON (even typing it feels wrong ugh). People making life changing gains overnight, and your mind goes \"*hmm, why don't I just put a bit in?\"* and before you know it, a drop comes, anxiety floods your body and you panic sell, wiping out some (or even all if you're leveraged) of your portfolio.

Whether you're accumulating a coin you see value in for the long term (talking about the big boys here - BTC, ETH, ADA etc) or you're just looking to take advantage of the bull market, avoiding FOMO is crucial. Here's a few tips that I've picked up during my time here -\n\n1. **Utilize/follow a range of resources and perspectives -** We all love the daily, don't we? But it can be a bit of an echo chamber. Consider looking at other subreddits as well. For every WSB there's a personal finance subreddit who think that crypto is worse than terrorism. But even if you disagree with them, it's healthy to see the other side of the coin (no pun intended lol). And whilst we're at it, try and extend your research to other sites too (YT, Podcasts, Twitter, Coindesk, White papers, General news sites etc etc) Yes these places can be echo chambers too, but just try to follow a range of people (e.g. Benjamin Cowen on YT, macro guys like Raoul Pal on Twitter etc, not just Mo0nboi69). You want to be getting info from as many places as possible. Edit - Read the **monthly skeptics thread** as well found [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mhj2sb/monthly_skeptics_discussion_april_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n2. **Ask yourself why -** Why are you investing in your chosen coin/project? What is the value proposition? What problem is it *actually* trying to solve? If the project sounds too good to be true then it probably is (\\*cough\\* anything with the word SAFE in \\*cough\\*).\n3. **Ask  the right questions -** If you don't know about something, then please ask questions before investing, but ask the *right* questions. Don't just ask *\"Do you think this project is gonna moons soon\"* or *\"what low cap coin is gonna 10x in the next few weeks?\",* stupid questions get stupid answers.\n4. **Learn the basics -** If you are going to try trading, or just enjoy staring at charts (We all love doing it, right?) then consider learning the basics of charts. Basic patterns, tools etc, there are more than enough videos on YT explaining this. I'd recommend going for one that doesn't just focus on crypto as well, as there is a wider range out there.\n5. **Don't overthink it and don't be greedy -** We're ALL guilty of this. You're sitting at your fiat mining job, just daydreaming about your potential gains. *\"Well I'm already up 3x, BUT if I cash out now I might miss out on 10x and could afford x car or x holiday, so I won't sell\".* I know. It's a tough mental battle. But if you have a gains target that you hit, then try to stick to it. Or failing that, at least consider DCAing out (selling portions of your positions gradually rather than in one go). We all want that big moon shot, but when the gains come it can really play with your mind and emotions.\n\nWell, that just my 2 sats. Should be worth noting that I'm no expert. I'm just another regular guy looking to escape the train wreck that is fiat currency, and become slightly more financially free.\n\nBest of luck guys, I really hope you all hit your goals xo\n\nSide note - I know this is nothing new, just wanted to share my thoughts as we've been getting a big inflow of new folk recently.

Our focus on Bitcoin causes us to dismiss a true decentralized store of value, and is bad for crypto in the long term.**\n\nAfter having first been thought up as a peer to peer electronic cash system, most Bitcoin enthusiasts have now shifted to seeing Bitcoin as being a store of value, a digital gold. My argument: Bitcoin is a terrible store of value. Anyone that claims that it's a fantastic store of value is either misinformed or pumping their bags to unload on those dumber/later than them. \n\nMy primary reason for saying Bitcoin is a terrible SoV:\n\n**Bitcoin's security**\n\nBitcoin's status as a decentralized digital store of value comes from, obviously, it being decentralized. It **should** therefore be seen as quite surprising that the consensus mechanism of Bitcoin, PoW mining using mostly ASICs, leads to centralization over time. Bitcoin mining is a business with economies of scale:\n\n1. Bigger size means negotiating power - with ASIC manufacturers for discounts, with energy producers for cheaper and more stable energy.\n2. Bigger size means cheaper capital - meaning that the discounted ASICs and energy can be paid for using cheaper funding.\n3. Bigger size means cheaper ASIC maintenance - as any data center employee will tell you.\n\nThere are myriad other small ways in which scale helps Bitcoin miners save on costs. Now, given a (1) reward for mining Bitcoin blocks and (2) economies of scale in costs for mining these blocks, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that this inherently leads to the big getting bigger.\n\nI'm not just making this up. If you're interested in research that looks into this feedback loop, see:\n\n* [Minting Money with Megawatts](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?reload=true&tp=&arnumber=7547426)\n* [Trend of centralization in Bitcoin's distributed network](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7176229) (which aptly states:  Centralization, due its simplicity, is a phenomenon that happens to any  disciplined and organized system automatically, which in case of Bitcoin  is against the pure initial decentralized nature of it and might arise some concerns and threats to the Bitcoin's unforeseeable future.)\n* [Taxonomy of centralization in public blockchain systems: A systematic literature review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306457321000844)\n* [Decentralization in Bitcoin and Ethereum Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.03998.pdf)\n* And finally, because I promised myself I'd only cite 5, and because some people might say \"yes, but miners in mining pools can just leave their pool and join a different one!\": [A Deep Dive into Bitcoin Mining Pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_30.pdf).\n\nIn short: economies of scale combined with mining rewards (fees + subsidy) both incentivise and rationally lead to the big getting bigger, leading to an oligopoly or monopoly. To add to that, any monopolist/oligopolist worth their salt could pretend to not hold a large proportion of hashrate.\n\n**Secondary, relatively minor blows to Bitcoin as a SoV:**\n\nBeing a store of value ultimately depends on **transactability** in the future. Gold is seen as a store of value because it is trustless - in a worst case scenario, I can carry around gold, hand it to you in exchange for goods and services, you can weigh it, verify it, and we'll happily trade. This can be very valuable during points in time (or geographical locations) where trust in currencies are lost, hence \"trustless\". \n\nBitcoin is technically trustless, but try handing some over in exchange for goods and services. It'd take a $50 fee currently, while you'd also have to awkwardly wait around for an hour or so to confirm that the transaction settled. Fine for large sums, not so fine if you have to do this every week, or every day, or in a country where $50 is a large sum.\n\nThe above is why we're seeing a move to 2nd layers. Bitcoin is practically unusable on its base layer. Now, don't get me started on Lightning, which is **still** expensive as opening/changing/closing channels happens on-chain, or you have to use a custodial solution, plus you throw away all security by using Lightning as you're now vulnerable to [Flood & Loot attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08513).\n\nI could add that Bitcoin's energy usage will disqualify it as a store of value for more and more institutional investors, but that deserves a post of its own.\n\n**My sad conclusion:**\n\nBitcoin is a terrible store of value for the long term. To be fair, I think that gold is too, as I think there comes a time when asteroid mining becomes viable. Do I think all crypto are a terrible store of value? No, I'm in crypto because I believe that the technology is there to have a decentralised store of value, it's just not Bitcoin. [I've written extensively about why I believe Nano is that store of value](https://senatusspqr.medium.com/why-nano-is-the-ultimate-store-of-value-and-reserve-currency-3b0318844bc8), my primary argument being that Nano has game theory that leads to decentralization over time. It also scales, meaning that trustless settlement remains possible for more than 7 people per second, and will remain a viable option for institutions because it has extremely low energy usage.\n\nSo why do I call this a sad conclusion? Because Bitcoin has a trillion dollar market cap, predicated mostly on it being a store of value. If I can figure out that Bitcoin's centralisation over time degrades its value proposition, and researchers can figure this out, then Bitcoin \"influencers\" must also know this. Institutional investors and those at the very top must know this, and probably know it far better than those of us investing small sums into Bitcoin. At some point, those big investors are going to sell, and we are only going to find out a month later, after the price has declined a lot. Rest assured that the big investors won't be the ones left holding the bag, nor will they give you a heads up before they shift out of Bitcoin.\n\nAt the risk of this post sounding like a Nano shill post rather than a fair analysis of Bitcoin's faults, I would urge anyone to think this through for themselves and compare Bitcoin's long-term value proposition to that of Nano. I believe that crypto genuinely offers us the chance of having a scaleable, hard money, and that our focus on Bitcoin rather than cryptocurrencies such as Nano [that actually offer this](https://senatusspqr.medium.com/why-nano-is-the-ultimate-store-of-value-and-reserve-currency-3b0318844bc8) is extremely detrimental to crypto in the long term. I'd also much prefer to have the people on here be the first ones to make this shift, rather than institutions or big investors.\n\nIf anyone's actually read all this, then thanks a lot and I'd love to hear your opinion on this.

If someone were to carry out some criminal or illegal activity and used bitcoins, that does not mean bitcoins are just for illicit activities.Criminals mostly use Fiat currency to carry out their criminal activities,they are doing it from so long.\nThe illegality debate stems from the fact that cryptocurrencies are not regulated. So yes, the Silk Road Raid incident of 2013 was an example of millions of dollars in bitcoins being used for drug and human trafficking. But let that not tarnish the entire system of blockchain and cryptocurrency as illegal. If bitcoins were never invented, real money would have been involved.\n \n2.Bitcoin network is prone to hacks : Cryptocurrencies are traded on platforms, just like other regular trading platforms. Since its launch in bitcoins have never suffered an attack on their network or blockchain. Protocol and cryptography rules have worked flawlessly over the years, and the system has shown no record of money theft or weakness in the system.\n\n3.BTC transactions are anonymous and untraceable: the cryptocurrency bitcoin blockchain is a public ledger that maintains a record of everything. Anonymity exists, but identifying user and user-details is not that much of a difficult task in extreme cases. The cryptocurrency system provides user anonymity just like any other system or platform, but it is not absolute anonymity.\n\n4. Bitcoin is not taxed: Cryptocurrencies are decentralized \u2013 there is no central regulatory authority, and no banks are involved. But that does not mean that cryptocurrencies can evade taxation. Any transaction in cryptocurrency, be it buying or selling, has tax implications.\n\n5. Only leading developers can make blockchains: The original bitcoin protocol is open source, and anyone can access and modify it. This is known as forking the bitcoin blockchain. All the different cryptocurrencies are different variations of bitcoins in some shape or form. For a long time, there was a myth that only leading developers could create blockchains. But with websites like forkgen.tech, anyone can fork the bitcoin blockchain and make their own cryptocurrency.\n\n6.Bitcoin is Blockchain and Blockchain is Bitcoin : \nBitcoins are globally known as blockchain technology, and because of that, both are used interchangeably. In layman's terms, blockchain technology supports bitcoins, and bitcoin is the cryptocurrency that makes peer-to-peer transactions possible.It is not wrong to assume that blockchain technology is critically essential for all cryptocurrencies.But  IOTA is a cryptocurrency that is blockchain-less and uses directed acyclic graphs to provide security.\n\nWhat are the various Myths you have heard about BTC and other Crypto currencies ??"}, {"title": "As the Crypto world starts gaining some momentum again, stay safe.

I'm hoping for some well informed discussion and explanations of exactly how and why it could be a rug pull, or what else is going on with this token.\n\nDoes anyone have clear evidence that it is? My biggest reason for thinking it isn't is that the idea of a deflationary coin in itself is incredibly rewarding for someone who gets in early, so the creators have no need to plan a rug pull or complicated scam.\n\nSafemoon takes 10% from each transaction and reinvests in itself. 5% goes directly to holders and 5% is burned, increasing the value of the remaining tokens. It taxes transactions at 10%, a huge number, and rewards holders with that.\n\nCirculating supply is a bit more than 600,000,000,000,000 right now, when all is burned 1,000,000,000,000 will be left. That's 600 times less, meaning each remaining safemoon will be worth 600 more based just on rewards taken from transactions. At the recent $4b market cap, that would mean a per token price of $.004. $100 invested now will become worth $60000 just from the deflation/rewards taken from those who transacted their safemoons and were taxed.\n\nI can see how it's very ponzi schemey, but unless there's some hidden shenanigans in the code, it's just a token with a built in mechanism for greatly rewarding early adopters and long term holders. Those who sell agree to give 10% back. If people keep transacting until all sm is burned, which seems like it will happen very fast with recent volumes, holders will by design be rewarded with 600x gains from holding. \n\nAll you need to be successful is to get in relatively early and get out after the burning, the tokenomics should reward you. Since so many of these projects were launched around the same time, the most viral one will grow fastest and \"work\" as designed, and safemoon clearly has the most intense (albeit spammy) marketing, and is well on its way to succeeding with 40% burned after only a couple months of existence.\n\nAm i misunderstanding or missing something?"}, {"title": "Emily Ratajkowski Will Sell NFT in Effort to \u2018Reclaim My Image\u2019", "score": 2, "url": "https://decrypt.co/69042/emily-ratajkowski-will-sell-nft-in-effort-to-reclaim-my-image", "selftext": ""}, {"title": "I bought some BNB on trust and it hasn't shown up in my wallet, but the transaction says it's pending in my checking account.", "score": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mypufs/i_bought_some_bnb_on_trust_and_it_hasnt_shown_up/", "selftext": " \n\nTrust isn't showing me that I even bought any BNB, will it eventually show up once the pending transaction in my checking account goes through?\n\nThis might seem like a dumb question but this is my first time using Trust Wallet and I would expect something to show up on the app even if the transaction hasn't gone through yet.\n\nCan anyone help?"}, {"title": "There is now a an actual shit coin - introducing ,poo coin\u2018", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/myptu9/there_is_now_a_an_actual_shit_coin_introducing/", "selftext": "\nJust when You think coin names couldn\u2019t get any worse we now have an actual shit coin.\n\nAm i missing the joke ?

A story about risk/reward.", "score": 14, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mym8m2/my_experience_with_and_tips_for_bsc_shitcoin/", "selftext": "**Disclaimer**\n\nYou know the drill, this is not financial advice, these are just my personal experiences. I wanted to share this as I've seen a lot of people ridiculing memecoins and BSC projects on here lately and I was the same not too long ago.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**A quick introduction**\n\nI have been in crypto since 2017. A friend and coworker was constantly talking about it but I had little experience except mining some bitcoin in 2011 (r\u00e9ally wish I didn't stop after a week). I bought some Iota, some Vechain and some other altcoins. The bear market came and I stopped investing and kind of ignored my portfolio while other things in life demanded my attention until early 2020 when I had some money leftover and invested more in crypto. Got some bitcoin, some ADA and stupidly traded my VET. Anyway, the point of all this: I never had much to invest but build around a $2000 portfolio of BTC and alts. Through the fluctuations this year my portfolio has been hovering between $8000 and $10.000 roughly. A nice 5x return, but it took several years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The rise of the meme/shitcoin**\n\nOf course there's always been Doge, but in recent months we've seen the meteoric rise of the BSC memecoin in many different forms. Safemoon, Safestar, Safedog, Safecat, ElonSafe, Safelon. The list is literally endless as they're created faster than I can write them down. I laughed it off at first like many probably did. I had a steady portfolio that I trusted would someday become my retirement fund. Why would I gamble on some pump&dump memecoin that would probably rugpull? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**One shot, one opportunity**\n\nUntil one day I was feeling lucky and decided to just take a gamble. I researched some projects all night long and picked three different ones. One was Safemoon, one was Fox Finance and the other was Safestar. I will go into the reasoning for these three later. I really was hyped at this point and wanted to invest immediately, but decided to go to bed first. Sleep on it. Next day I still wanted to do it, so I checked the finances, bought the BNB and setup a Trust wallet for my BSC adventures only. I put around $50 into all three projects.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI picked Safemoon because it was gaining lots of traction. These coins really run on hype mostly and Safemoon had lots of it. I was kind of late to the party so I knew there were less returns to be had, but the chance of it being rugpulled were lower than with an unestablished coin. I picked Fox because it looked very legit. A nice website, a friendly telegram server, a legit charity aspect and a 'good' roadmap (you can't compare these tokens to a proper coin's paper of course, they're literally hopes and dreams that might very well never come to fruition). Safestar was my YOLO bet. Either I was gonna get scammed or I'd be in early on the next moonshot. Now my three bets were spread across three quite different projects.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/8xy6k8jv2fv61.gif\n\n**\"Nonononono, that's a scam!\"**\n\nI stared at my money constantly and nothing much happened. It went up and down but I didn't see nowhere near the 100x returns that all the post titles on r/cryptomoonshots were promising me! I got bored, as millenials do when they don't become millionaires within a week after investing, and kind of wrote this stuff off as a scam and just went back to hodling my legit coins. I didn't really touch my Trust wallet for a few weeks and opened it back up around a month after I bought into these projects. My jaw dropped to the floor when I checked the value of my 'investment'. My $150 had turned into over 10BNB worth around $7000 (better days). My entire crypto 'career' of four years I managed to scrape together $8k and now suddenly I had made $7k in a month. I just smiled and grinned that entire day. I wasn't scammed. I wasn't rugpulled. Fox gave me amazing returns of between 50 and 100x at ATH, Safemoon got a little less and Safestar never gave me even 2x. Still, the overall return was mindblowing and none of the coins lost me even a dollar. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Make your exit plan**\n\nI didn't have an exit plan at all when I got into this. I never expected these kind of returns. So I made one up as I went, slowly cashing out around 10% at certain milestones. When my Fox hit 5BNB, I took out 0.5. I made that back within an hour. That same night it hit 8 and I took another 0.8 out. Just days later I had $1000+ in my Binance account. I've never had more than $100 at a time in there. I felt like a kid in a candystore, picking out coins for my long term portfolio, doubling my ADA position with what felt like free money. I had more than made my initial investment back and like the gambling addict I had become, I decided to look for more memecoins to put part of my newly made profits into. I also sent my crypto-newbie girlfriend $50 in BNB to play around with as a simple introduction to crypto. Normally I'd suggest Doge for that, but uh... not at 40 cents a coin. We picked out some projects together. She picked Bonfire and Bingus. One because it looked decent and was picking up lots of hype and one because it was a cat. Sound logic for sure! You really have to put your logic aside with these memecoins. There are basically no fundamentals, you're just picking the ones that you think are going to pick up the most steam. Just three days later her $50 turned into nearly $700 proving once again that these memecoins really are capable of doing insanely fast returns.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ob4dsy913fv61.gif\n\n**The time I got rugged**\n\nI got into a few more coins myself. Joined my girlfriend in Bonfire and Bingus and picked another one called Happy. These all turned out to be good projects with so far returns of between 0.8x (Bonfire) and 6x (Happy) within less than a week. I said I was done until a new one popped up on Cryptomoonshots: Capybara. Capybaras are my favorite animal and even though everything looked sketchy as hell, I decided to put a few leftover bucks in just for fun. The dev was really unprofessional in the telegram and within a few hours of it launching, the dev was gone from the channel and all the reddit posts were removed. He got out with just a few BNB and tainted the name of the lovely, peaceful Capybara for a few thousand bucks. The only good thing was the Telegram channel after the rugpull. Getting scammed together kind of bonds people. Still wouldn't recommend this as your #1 way to make friends as it can get costly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How to avoid scams and find gems**\n\nYou never know for sure what BSC projects are gonna pull the rug, but you can at least check for some vital signs of scammery. A token launching without a website is usually the sign of a really lazy scammer. A presale can be another red flag. For already launched tokens, always check the wallet distribution as with any coin or token you're getting into. Check if the liquidity is locked and for how long. Preferably check the devs if possible. Some of these tokens have been audited and have Doxxed devs which really helps build trust. Pick unique projects with something that differentiates them from others. Don't get SafeMusk, DogeMoon or MoonLambo. A simple to remember name that stands out, a logo that looks professional and a site that looks like it wasn't made in 5 minutes really help. A lot of new coins have a charity element and have actually donated thousands of dollars already. This is not only great for obvious reasons, but it also really helps with the marketing and improves the chances of it mooning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou will always have to play the game of risk/reward here. Hopping onto a brand new coin within an hour of launch can be v\u00e9ry profitable but the risk is way higher. Waiting a bit for an audit, a community, a dev doxx, a few AMAs or even an exchange listing makes the chance of getting rugged way lower but you probably will miss that 100x chance by waiting. This is something that everyone should decide for themselves. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/uhj38xd43fv61.gif\n\n**Sir, this is a casino**\n\nAs with any investment \u00e1nd any gamble, you should never invest what you're not willing to lose. You're absolutely insane if you put your life savings into a BSC memecoin. You could come out a millionaire but the chances are way bigger that you'll end up homeless. These coins aren't like your normal investment where you spend days learning about the usecase, the fundamentals, the code, the devs. They're a casino where you manage your risk versus reward. Do you bet on red by buying into an 'established' memecoin? Or do you put it all on 27 and hope for that big risky payday? Just like in a casino, be prepared to go home broke. This doesn't mean the casino is a scam. People willingly go in and gamble, just like on BSC. And just because you lost some money on BSC does not mean the entirety of it is a scam and should be avoided. I am nowhere near done and have already made more profits on BSC than in four years of legit crypto investing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**A few groundrules:**\n\n1. As usual, only invest what you're willing to lose. I suggest not using more than $50 on your first bet but of course adjust to your own financial situation.\n\n2. How risk-averse are you? This probably isn't for you if you only invested in safe coins like BTC so far.\n\n3. You h\u00e1ve to get used to the red candles. You're gonna see a lot of them and they're gonna be big. If you panic sell at each sign of red, you're gonna be broke real soon. In return, green candles will probably be plentiful too.\n\n4. This is a side hustle. Memecoins should, obviously, not be your main investment strategy. Buy your proper coins for the week/month and put a few tenners into BSC. It's kind of like buying a lottery ticket with your leftover grocery money. Except you might make actual money. Don't take out your life savings or sell your ETH for this. This is way too risky and besides, doing so makes it way too emotional. Seen many people in the telegrams do this and they usually panic sell for a loss because it's basically impossible to mentally deal with the volatility of these memecoins if your life savings are riding on it. \n\n5. Give it a month. The telegram channels for these coins are full of people panicking or calling everything a scam because they can't buy a lambo for their $10 investment after three days. These are highly volatile but even a memecoin takes a few weeks to truly get going. \n\n6. Don't stare at the price all day, especially with new coins. Less holders means more volatility and you will see entire BNB's evaporate in seconds when big whales dump early on. I suggest not looking at your value especially if you're prone to panic selling. Usually this settles down a bit and turns into more natural movement as more people get in. Example: I bought 2BNB of Happy an hour after it launched. Woke up the next day with 11BNB. An hour later it was 3.5. Now, a few days later, it's back over 10 and now the price movement is way more natural. Learn to love the volatility and learn to trust in the project, even if it is a sketchy memecoin. You still picked it for a reason, hopefully. Constantly switching to the next one will probably not make you more money than the good old mantra of HODL.\n\n7. Decide your exit strategy up front. Are you gonna cash out everything once you hit 10x? Or cash out 10% at certain levels? I suggest always at least letting a little bit ride as you don't wanna be the guy who sold his Safemoon for a few bucks profit and missed the 1000x rocket. Take your initial investment plus some profit out early if you get emotional. This makes hodling a lot easier as you already profited and are now playing with house money. Also make sure you're realistic. Don't expect a random memecoin to get to $0.01 and overtake BTC in market cap. Trust me, I've seen plenty of people get way too hyped and claim stupid shit like this.\n\n8. Learn to use Trust wallet. New memecoins will not display value. This doesn't mean you got scammed. Always check your value on Pancakeswap. It's the only real price that you can actually sell for. Charts and wallet values are usually wrong or behind. Also be weary that almost all of these charge a fee of up to 12% for liquidity and to give back to holders, so cashing out after you've gained 10% will actually cost you money.\n\n9. Have fun! Join the telegrams/discords. They're usually a fun place to hang around. There's lots of crypto newbies asking the same questions a 1000 times a day, along with people panicking over each drop. Millions of memes. But the overall atmosphere is usually great and positive even through all the chaos. Active devs are a great sign.\n\n10. If it's not for you, don't go around declaring it a scam all over r/crytocurrency. Price volatility doesn't mean scam. Yes these memecoins are stupid and there's lots of scams among them, we all know that. But just ignore them and continue on investing in legit projects. There's plenty of crypto scams in the 'real' crypto community as well. Let people enjoy things and don't go around FUD'ing something you have no experience with. I will be enjoying this crazy ride until it inevitably ends and I'll look back on it with a smile and a big fat portfolio full of legit coins. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, that was my presentation. I guess this sub will forever mock these and it's pretty hard not to. 98% has a stupid name, no usecase and will probably die an early death but if you use a bit of brain and have a bit of luck picking the right ones, returns on these can be absolutely massive regardless and it's a great way to expand your legit portfolio with just a few bucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*TLDR:* Memecoins are great if you treat them as what they are: a gamble instead of a legitimate crypto investment.

There's always a select group of insiders that will have the info before the rest of the group, ready to dump on their faces. \n\n\nMy friend introduced me to a discord called \"Big Pump Signal\" this month. They have videos on their discord and telegram of their 200k+ members doing scheduled pump and dumps on random coins on [Binance.com](https://Binance.com). \n\nWe saw a video of one of there pumps that sent a project soaring 3x past the starting price. We didn't believe it was real until we waited for the next pump to happen. Their scheduled pump was $VIA and they took it up 2x before it started dumping (around 20 minutes after the pump).\n\nSeeing this made us both think we could get some easy gains by following this group's pump signals and getting out before the dump...so this past Saturday rolled around and we got ready to pump the new coin that they'd be announcing at 5PM. The coin announcement dropped at 5PM..and by 5:15 the coin has already dumped about 25%...I wasn't able to buy in on this one thankfully (US citizen and didn't have my Binance account set up) but my friend did..and he lost 25% of his BTC...the coin had pumped 30-45 minutes before schedule..leaving the regular group members to eat losses\n\nThe gist of the scam is as follows:\n\n\\-Get a lot of people in a discord or telegram group that want to make quick money (typically new investors)\n\n\\-Create 2-3 pumps that actually work and allow people to profit or Post some fake videos of \"successful pumps\"\n\n\\-Announce coin that is being pumped only at the exact time the pump starts, pressuring the participants to buy fast and drop their whole bag on the project being \"pumped\"\n\n\\-People running the PnD buy the coin BEFORE they announce it is pumping just to dump on the heads of those who buy in when the coin is announced.\n\nNow, as I said, my friend and I saw 2 successful pumps happen via this group before we got scammed. I would like to first point how how the leaders of the operation likely executed the final operation. The pumps are scheduled for a specific time on a specific day about a week in advance, but no one is told what coin will be pumped until the moment of the pump. I suspect the leaders took payment from a select group who would then be given the name of the coin early, as it seemed to pump about 30-45 minutes before the originally scheduled pump.\n\nFinally, I want to point out why participating in these PnDs is a terrible idea--completely aside from the fact that you will likely get scammed and lose money. A PnD is very much like a ponzi scheme. The people who buy first are able to make some nice profits by dumping their coins on the ones who are unlucky enough to buy the top. Remember, any time you sell crypto, you are selling to a real person. This said, anytime someone profits in a PnD, they are dumping the coin on to someone who is usually less informed about what they are doing, leaving that person with a fat loss. This isn't a win against big corporations, investment firms, or the banking system...this is a \"win\" at the expense of the guy next to you in that discord or telegram group. \n\n Be wise in analyzing these \"get rich quick\" schemes...if it seems too good to be true..it probably is."}, {"title": "Is trading worth it?", "score": 15, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mylssh/is_trading_worth_it/", "selftext": "Hello my dudes.

Here's some of his main points along with my comments:\n\n>It has no intrinsic value. You can\u2019t eat it, wear it, or heat your house with it. Unlike gold \u2014 which at least feels nice and looks shiny on your spouse\u2019s ring finger \u2014 you can\u2019t even see Bitcoin.\n\nFiat also has no intrinsic value. I suppose we should consider government issued currency a Ponzi scheme as well. Guess what? Value always has been and always will be *subjective*. If I believe that a bubble gum wrapper with some already chewed up gum is worth $1000, then it actually is worth $1000. I think I remember a piece of toast with the burn mark in the shape of Jesus being sold for quite a bit online. Something has value if we all agree that it has value. With increasing income inequality in the world, many of us are all beginning to agree that fiat has decreasing value, thus why we hodl.\n\n>It is not a productive asset. It\u2019s not a factory that produces an item. It\u2019s not a field that produces cucumbers. It\u2019s not a firm that offers a service. It contributes nothing to society.\n\nThis is him again arguing for his own *subjective* theory of value. Not everything that is produced in a factory or a service that is rendered directly to a consumer is something that has value. Productivity is also subjective. I might not think that fidget spinners are very productive and may be a waste of factory equipment, but that does not mean they have no value to anyone else. To say that Bitcoin and cryptocurrency contribute nothing to society is completely false. Just read all the posts here from Venezuelans empowering themselves with crypto in the face of their nearly worthless government currency.\n\n>It has zero underlying value. None. It\u2019s not backed by land or commodities or \u2014 as with national currencies like USD or GBP \u2014 the threat of violence (in the form of wage garnishment, asset seizure, and imprisonment.)\n\nI'll not repeat myself here. I'll add that not being backed by government violence or wage garnishment is a much desired feature, and pretty much the point why many of us get into crypto in the first place. What Bitcoin is backed by is our cooperation in maintaining the network and confirming each other's transactions.\n\n>It has minimal utility. Because the price fluctuates so wildly (what healthy currency doubles in a month?), it\u2019s virtually ineffective as a safe representation of value or means of trade.\n\nWell, better get on that GME stock! Joking aside, I don't think most people would complain if their country's currency doubled in a month. Also, the traditional stock market fluctuates widely on sentiment alone or if a CEO smokes a joint on a popular podcast. Are the traditional markets really any more safe given that there are more favourable rules for those who are already wealthy? Also, with respect to utility, we just have to look at all the projects leveraging cryptocurrency for novel ways to exchange value with each other. I would have never predicted that NFTs would be a thing, or if I did, wouldn't have predicted that it would be widely popular and in the local news.\n\n>Its value is solely derived from the trust that the price will continue to rise indefinitely. That there will always be new investors to buy out the old ones.\n\nIf he thinks that the value of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin in particular, is solely derived from its indefinite rise, he must not have done much research on it. This statement I found to be particularly lazy. Again, we agree on what has value, and we desire an alternative way to conduct transactions irrespective of government or corporate control. It's not just about the price rising indefinitely, it's more about fiat deflating indefinitely due to unlimited money printing. Bitcoin's price rising is only a side effect. The fact that there will only ever be a certain amount of Bitcoins *is* stability. We have no idea how much money governments will print and how much debt they will take on. The only proper answer to that question given what we (don't) know is *infinity*.\n\nI'll admit that I really don't know all that much about cryptocurrency and Bitcoin. But I know enough to recognize crap when I see it."}, {"title": "What a \u201cmoons\u201d and how do I get them?", "score": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/myf8ws/what_a_moons_and_how_do_i_get_them/", "selftext": "I keep seeing all of these messages about moons.

Over the course of your life you sell tens of  thousands of oranges because you have the only Orange grove for thirty miles around and the pirates who live at the docks don\u2019t want scurvy.

Often times, we label Bitcoin as \"the internet of money\" or \"digital gold\", but I believe that Bitcoin as money is pretty much broken and the digital gold is not a fitting one.\n\n* Point 1, \"the internet of money\". \n   * Per the whitepaper, Bitcoin is implied to be a \"A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash\" and in the whitepaper it's mentioned that one of the downsides of traditional electronic payments is that \"the cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions\". \n   * I know this paper was published in 2008, but let's fast forward to today. We have widely used systems like Apple Pay and Venmo which allow us to transfer money without fees, while the average Bitcoin transaction fees are $29 today, and reached all time highs of $61 in April 21st. This shows us that Bitcoin is no better than traditional payments for \"small casual transactions\" and thus unusable to be called peer-to-peer cash\n* Point 2, \"digital gold\"\n   * In 2008, during one of the worst economic periods ever, gold \"only\" dropped 27%, while we have seen Bitcoin drop multiple times over 50% during bear markets.\n   * During the covid pandemic:\n      * Gold went from 1570 in February 11th 2020 to 1487 in March 16th 2020 (lowest in this time period), a 6% drop.\n      * BTC dropped from 10.2k in February 11th 2020 to 5200 in March 17th 2020, a 49% drop. Bitcoin's volatility definitely does not make it a store of value, though it is true that based on historical performance, Bitcoin is orders of magnitude better as an investment than gold\n   * I have made a post about this [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mf5or1/unpopular_opinion_bitcoin_is_a_hypergrowth_tech/), but I believe that instead of \"digital gold\" bitcoin should just be called what it is a hypergrowth digital asset. \n   * Now, what made Bitcoin rise in popularity and demand since its inception? Its usability as digital money. Nowadays, people are buying it just to speculate, and I believe that usability over time beats speculation. As long as Bitcoin keeps being unusable as money, I believe that in the long term other coins will outperform it.\n\nSo Bitcoin is slow and expensive to transfer, and as we have recently seen with the hashrate drops in China, it is highly centralized for a decentralized system. The only benefit that Bitcoin really has is first mover's advantage and brand name, which I believe that over time isn't really a real advantage.\n\n(Other point that I believe are worth mentioning that are not often mentioned in this sub)\n\n* Point 3, contamination\n   * It is no secret that Bitcoin is extremely power hungry, consuming 129 TWh, 60% of which does not come from renewable energies. All of the world's data centers consume 205 TWh, and I don't believe that Bitcoin is even remotely close to be as necessary as all of the data centers combined, which shows how massively inefficient Bitcoin is in terms of electricity ([source](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-the-power-consumption-of-bitcoin-mining/)). The worst part in all of this is that power usage will just increase with time if Bitcoin becomes more and more popular due to increases in difficulty. Quite frankly from an environmental perspective, Bitcoin's power usage is simply not worth it, and something should be done about it.\n\nIt makes me a bit sad, since when I first heard about Bitcoin in the summer of 2016 I was really excited about it, since it mixed 2 of my big interests (Computer Science and money). But nowadays I'm more passionate about other projects that I don't want to mention in this post because I don't want this to be a shill post.

I knew what it was at a high level but didn't understand the details of it. Well now I've taken an economics course and have done some research, and figured I would share this guide for anyone who finds themselves in the same position as I was. I tried my best to explain it in the simplest terms. There's a chance that I've understood something incorrectly so if you find a mistake please tell me so I can edit the post. I wouldn't want to spread false information to the 20 people that see this.\n\n**TLDR: The following points summarize each section of this post:**\n\n* **Inflation is the decrease in purchasing power of a currency. 10 dollars in 2021 do not carry as much value as 10 dollars in 1980.**\n* **Inflation is used to create more money for the government to pay off debts and to stimulate economic growth. Too much inflation is bad, no inflation is also bad: there's a sweet spot.**\n* **Because of inflation, an investment can earn profits without increasing your purchasing power, which basically means you're \"losing money\" in a relative sense.**\n* **Inflation in measured by expressing the value of the currency in terms of a constant value asset. The value of the currency at a fixed point in time is often used as a benchmark.**\n* **Hyperinflation happens when purchasing power decreases too quickly, which creates a cycle that causes the value of the currency to plummet. This usually has disastrous effects on the economy.**\n* **Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation because it is a deflationary asset. As purchasing power decreases with inflation, the price of Bitcoin increases to preserve (and increase) its own purchasing power.**\n\n# What is inflation?\n\nInflation is the decrease in purchasing power of a currency (i.e. increase in prices). What does this mean? Let's look at it anecdotally: Have you ever had a grandparent (or other old person) say to you: \"When I was your age I could buy a coffee for 10 cents. Now it costs me over a dollar!\" This increase in price is due to inflation.\n\nTo fully understand this you have to make the distinction between the price and the value (or purchasing power) of a currency. The price of a currency describes how much the currency is worth with respect to the current value of the currency. So for example, $1 in 2021 = $1 in 2021. Obviously this is true for any year, $1 = $1 always. Yes this is a bit redundant, but it's important to grasp to make the distinction between price and value.\n\nThe value of a currency, or purchasing power, is not as easy. Over time it decreases. For example, $1 in 2021 \u2260 $1 in 1971. In fact, $1 in 2021 < $1 in 1971. Think about it using the coffee example: in 1971 a dollar could buy you 10 coffees. Today the same dollar can't even buy one whole coffee. So a dollar can buy you less coffee today than it could in 1971. In other words, the purchasing power of the dollar went down. This is inflation.\n\n# Why does inflation happen?\n\nThere are many causes for inflation that I won't pretend to fully understand. You can read about them [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2011/05/30/what-actually-causes-inflation/?sh=69a53d62f9a9).\n\nThe main cause of inflation that relates to cryptocurrency is when the government introduces more money into circulation. They do this for a few reasons.\n\n* To pay off their debts. If the government doesn't have enough money to cover their debts they just... make more. This is especially relevant today as COVID relief plans are sending governments further into debt.\n* To encourage buying and stimulate the economy. If people know that their dollars are going to be worth less in the future they are more likely to buy things in the present (to get the most out of their money, so to speak) which is good for the economy.\n\nThe above reasons are broken down into very simple terms. In reality things are much more complex.\n\nOver the course of this post (if you bother reading it through) you might get the impression that inflation is always a bad thing. I think it's important to note that having no inflation is bad for the economy as well. An absence of inflation means money will increase in value, so people make money by simply holding on to their cash (think of the Bitcoin hodl mentality). Obviously this is bad for the economy as there is less and less spending. There is less demand so prices drop. companies become less profitable so they decrease wages to increase their margins.\n\nWe can see that having no inflation is not good. And we'll see later that having too much is not good either. There's a \"sweet spot\" for inflation that the government targets in an attempt to get all the benefits of inflation without any of the drawbacks. This target rate is usually 2%. Whether or not this actually works I have no idea.\n\n# What does this mean for investors?\n\nBasically what this means in that if you're earning a rate of return that is lower than the inflation rate, you're actually losing purchasing power, even though you're gaining money. Let's look at an example:\n\nLet's say you want to buy an item that costs $1000 but you only have $980 available to spend. You put this money in a saving account that earns 0.5% interest. In 5 years, you will have 980\\*1.0055 = $1,004.75. Now you head to the store to buy the $1000 item, except that you forgot to factor in 2% inflation: when you get to the store the item now costs 1000\\*1.025 = $1,104.08.\n\nHow we interpret this? Well in year 0, you could afford 980/1000 = 98% of the price of the item. In year 5, you can afford 1004.75/1104.08 = 91% of the price of the item. In other words your purchasing power went down, even though you gained more money.\n\nBecause of this, we as investors need to look for investments that not only make us money (i.e. profits), but also increase our purchasing power. To do this, you should only pick investments whose rate or return is higher than the inflation rate.\n\n# How do we measure inflation?\n\nInflation rates are measured using indices like the Consumer Price Index (this is one example, there are many others). The CPI calculates inflation by tracking price changes for thousands of products, services and pretty much anything that costs money. They track this by obtaining prices from sellers/providers every month, and calculating the average percent change in price month over month. Here are the yearly inflation rates as per the CPI:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[US inflation rates between 1914 and 2021. I'm not sure why the vertical axis doesn't extend into the negative.](https://preview.redd.it/0yes9r4b99v61.png?width=1776&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7924a8d98d31840b306c5e08319352270ccca52)\n\nWhen the inflation rate is positive (green bar), purchasing power decreased that year (in comparison to the previous year). When the inflation rate is negative (red bar), purchasing power increased that year (this is called deflation).\n\nThe CPI uses this information to calculate the value of the US dollar. To express the value of a currency over time, a constant value benchmark is often used. For example, this could be done by expressing the value of the dollar in terms of how many apples $1 could buy. $1 might buy you 20 apples in 1960, but only 2 in 2021 (These are made up numbers for the sake of the example). Instead of using apples as the base value, the CPI uses the average value of the dollar between 1982 and 1984. The yearly index values are shown here (with the above graph overlain):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[CPI \\(blue\\) and average inflation rate \\(red\\) between 1913 and 2019. The red line is the same as the above bar graph.](https://preview.redd.it/fq2pg4wf99v61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=36478fb8d002052702457f95c29b18c5d7301ff8)\n\nOn this graph, the blue line shows the ratio of the value of the dollar between 1982 and 1984 (average value over this period) to the value of the dollar in that year (expressed as a percentage). More simply put, the blue line tracks how many dollars in that year have the same value as $100 did between 1982 and 1984 (3-year average) . So if we look all the way to the left, in 1913 approximately $10 had the same value as $100 in 1982-1984. Similarly, in 2019 approximately $260 dollars had the same value as $100 in 1982-1984.\n\nA couple of interesting things to take note of on this graph:\n\n* The blue line hits 100 around 1983. This makes sense since $100 dollars in 1982-1984 were worth $100 dollars in 1982-1984.\n* When the inflation rate (red line) is above zero, the CPI (blue line) trends upwards. When the inflation rate is below zero, the CPI trends downwards. This makes sense since the red line describes the rate of change of blue line.\n\n# What is hyperinflation?\n\nHyperinflation happens when there is a sudden, significant decrease in purchasing power. This happens when inflation \"goes too far\" and the sudden decrease in purchasing power starts a vicious cycle: As the value of a currency plummets, those that hold the currency rush to exchange it for an asset that will preserve its value. This in turn pushes the value of the currency even further down, and the cycle continues.\n\nSome examples of hyperinflation are:\n\n* The Weimar Republic: After the first world war, Germany owed many debts and reparations that they simply couldn't afford. To pay them off they tried to print more money, and hyperinflation ensued.\n* Zimbabwe: Once again due to excessive money printing, in 2008 Zimbabwe saw an inflation rate of 80B%. There is a pretty big name in the crypto community who carries a Zimbabwe billion dollar bill in his wallet as a reminder of what can happen to fiat currencies. 10 moons to the first Redditor to name this person.\n* Venezuela: This is an ongoing period of instability for Venezuela's currency that began in 2016. Many of you may know that a fellow Redditor in this community runs a crypto fundraising campaign to bring food to her community that is affected by this.\n\nHyperinflation is very bad for the economy: as currency becomes worthless, everything becomes very expensive, people can't afford as much and the economy comes to a halt. It also erodes trust in the government and banks.\n\n# How does Bitcoin solve this problem?\n\nTo counteract the effects of inflation, or in other words to preserve the purchasing power of our wealth over time, we use an inflation hedge. An inflation hedge is an investment whose growth equals or exceed the rate of inflation, so by investing in the hedges you are preserving or increasing the buying power of the money that you invested. Some common inflation hedges are gold, income producing real estate (i.e. rental properties), well-performing stock market indices or ETFs, and some specific bonds that protect against inflation.\n\nThe key to Bitcoin functioning as an inflation hedge lies in the fact that it has a maximum supply. Compare Bitcoin to the dollar. As more dollars enter into circulation the purchasing power of those dollars goes down (assuming the \"demand\" for the dollar remains relatively constant). Contrarily, since the amount of Bitcoin has a hard cap and cannot be increased, the purchasing power also remains constant (or rather increases, since the demand for Bitcoin will always be increasing, even if it's much slower than right now). So we will see that, like gold, the price of Bitcoin will slowly increase to match or outpace the rate of inflation, preserving its purchasing power. This is why Bitcoin is considered a \"deflationary asset\".\n\nA couple of notes on this:\n\n* Right now Bitcoin is in it's infancy, and as the crypto-sphere grows the demand for Bitcoin increases much faster than what I assumed above  (so we see the price climbing extremely fast). In theory, we will eventually reach a point where Bitcoin is mainstream and it's demand increases organically (will growing population, for example), so the rise in demand will taper off and Bitcoin's value will increase more slowly (but will still act as an inflation hedge due to its fixed supply).\n* I also assumed Bitcoin to have a fixed supply. We all know this isn't true right now because of how Proof of Work is designed: as time goes on more Bitcoin enters into circulation. However, the increase in demand for Bitcoin is currently outpacing the rate at which new Bitcoins are introduced, so the price rises. Eventually the supply will reach a hard cap of 21 million.\n* Another important factor that I left out is how much Bitcoin is lost, and will continue to be lost. Because of this the effective supply of Bitcoin actually decreases, which will cause its price to increase (assuming constant demand).\n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for reading!

I`m curious what others have to say regarding the bear case for bitcoin. In my opinion bitcoin is largely propped up by branding and being first in the market.\n\nLet me start off by saying Bitcoin is old technology that I don't believe will be used as a real currency. The counter argument to this is that it is a store of value competing with gold. However, gold does has much wider applications which is why a direct comparison is a bit complicated.\n\nIf Bitcoin truly is going to be a store of value then shouldn't it be the fastest, cheapest, most private, etc? It is none of these things - it was just the first.\n\nEvery time I come to this subreddit I hope to see enlightening information like we did several years ago. Instead it is just spam from fake analysts making price predictions - clearly in an effort to keep the price moving (up).\n\nIt's like everyone is still in love with their old hatch back Honda Civic and doesn't replace it due to the fond memories associated with it. Meanwhile there are plenty of newer options that perform the same function but better. Bitcoin introduced the concept of crypto, but it was never meant to be final iteration.\n\nThis takes me to my final point, if a newer, faster, smarter, whatever coin/network gains traction in the \"store of value\" space then Bitcoin's brand won't save it. Many new investors may approach crypto with the mindset that they are not going to use a less optimal non-tangeable product for nostalgia.\n\nNow what is interesting is the institutional investors - their accumulation of bitcoin over the past year likely will prevent or lessen the effect of sudden crashes. And when I say crash, I mean true 50%+ drops - not healthy corrections and consolidations. Do you think institutions backing bitcoin recently have helped bitcoin or are we setting ourselves up for massive drops once these organizations hit their price targets and exit?\n\nEdit: I love the discussion points so far - keep it up!"}, {"title": "Factors driving irrational crypto investment behaviour in retail traders", "score": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/my87nc/factors_driving_irrational_crypto_investment/", "selftext": "Morning fellow crypto investors!
