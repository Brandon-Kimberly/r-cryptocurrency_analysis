So I know everyone hates on Paypal and Robinhood as places to buy crypto and in some ways with good reason. Here's a thought though, in some ways Paypal and Robinhood may actually be more secure. Hear me out...\n\nSo most of us these days feel pretty secure that an exchange isn't going to exit scam or even get hacked, and if they do and you're using a legit exchange they're most likely insured. Here's the real risk though, SIM Swaps and individual account hacks are incredibly common. Also the Robotic Takeover Attacks or whatever it's called where someone can basically control your phone from a computer. Not only is this fairly easy and common, but there's not a ton you can do to protect yourself, and yes accounts get hacked even with Authenticator 2FA on.\n\nWhile I don't like the fact Robinhood and Paypal don't let you move money off their platform and have that control over you, at the same time it's somewhat of a security measure. The anonymity of hacking your account and transferring your crypto out and mixing it can happen to anyone but if someone were to hack your Robinhood account all they can do is do a bank transfer which is easily traceable to them.\n\nI'm not suggesting people necessarily use Robinhood or Paypal but until the whole SIM Swap thing gets more secure some people may actually like buying through these platforms."}, {"title": "Tether's market cap tops $50 billion, supply on Tron surpasses Ethereum", "score": 4, "url": "https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/102831/tethers-market-cap-crosses-50-billion-its-issuance-on-tron-flips-ethereum", "selftext": ""}, {"title": "10 Years Ago Today, Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto Sent His Final Message", "score": 3, "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterizzo/2021/04/26/10-years-ago-today-bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-sent-his-final-message/", "selftext": ""}, {"title": "Binance To List Tokenised Shares of MicroStrategy, Apple, Microsoft", "score": 0, "url": "https://cryptocrunchapp.com/news/binance-to-list-tokenised-shares-of-microstrategy-apple-microsoft/", "selftext": ""}, {"title": "Collection of all coinbase earn answers!", "score": 5, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mz3fsm/collection_of_all_coinbase_earn_answers/", "selftext": "Hi everyone, just thought I'd post a collection of all the current/recent coinbase earn answers to save a couple minutes for anyone just getting started with crypto. \n\nI believe it's a total of around $40 in rewards you can currently earn on coinbase, and it only takes a few minutes!\n\nAmpleforth Answers\n\n1) What are Ampleforth's automatic supply changes called? \nRebases \n\n2) What two tokens give the community control over the Ampleforth protocol? \nAMPL and FORTH \n\n3) Ampleforth is a censorship resistant _________ that rebases once a day. \nDeFi building block\n\nCELO Answers\n\nBy making crypto accessible on mobile phones\nStaking, governance\nUsing the Valora mobile app\n\nNuCypher Answers\nQ1: What does NuCypher provide to users and apps?A1: End-to-end encryption\n\nQ2: What does NuCypher use to protect your data\nA2: Independent nodes to perform tasks\n\u200b\nQ3: Which of these is NOT a use of the NU token?\nA3: Paying Ethereum transaction fees\n\u200b\n\nCompound Answers\n1: Earn interest on crypto\n2: Supply crypto asset as collateral\n3: COMP token holders\n\u200b\nGraph Answers\nThe bitcoin network \nGRT Tokens \nCurators\n\n\nMKR Answers\nQ: What are the native assets of the Maker protocol?\nA: MKR and DAI\n\u200b\nQ: Who runs MakerDAO?\nA: MKR holders\n\u200b\nQ: What do you need to generate DAI today?\nA: A crypto wallet and crypto collateral\n\u200b\n\nBand coin Answers\nQ:What does Band bring to blockchains?\nA:Real World Data\n\u200b\nQ:What are Band\u2019s decentralized data feeds called?\nA:Oracles\n\u200b\nQ:What\u2019s one benefit of staking your BAND tokens?\nA:Earn crypto rewards\n\u200b\n\nXLM Answers\n1: A decentralized protocol that unites the world\u2019s financial infrastructure.\n2: Facilitating low-cost, universal payments.\n3: Transactions are fast, inexpensive, and global.\n4: To issue and exchange tokens quickly.\n5: It relies on a cooperation of trusted nodes."}, {"title": "How much will the price of UNI move by Monday, May 3rd?

Authoritarianism - Authoritarian countries, where they elect to regulate cryptocurrencies, are more likely to opt for an outright ban rather than nuanced money laundering regulations and taxation.\n2. Demand-led Opposition - Countries where there is likely to be a high demand for cryptocurrency services are less likely to *either* regulate or ban cryptocurrencies - including being less likely (for now) to tax the new sector of economic activity. This is particularly true where demand for the service translates to increased investment inflows.\n3. Pre-existing Regulatory Sophistication - Countries with a high degree of financial regulatory sophistication - here represented by CBI and (potentially) domestic credit % - are likely to be early adopters of cryptocurrency regulations, particularly more nuanced regulations related to taxation and money laundering, potentially intended to bring the new financial sector competitor in line with existing financial sector regulations.\n\n**Here's a link to the analysis:**  [https://practicalprogressive.substack.com/p/de-fi-deep-dive-part-vii](https://practicalprogressive.substack.com/p/de-fi-deep-dive-part-vii) \n\nI've tried to note some of the limitations here - if anyone knows any good data sources on cross-national crypto adoption rates, I'd love to get a better measure for some of these theoretical ideas.

Those are great features, but NANO is far more than that. It\u2019s decentralized, scalable, green, and has many other unique characteristics.\n\n\n**Decentralization**\n\nNANO is one of the only cryptocurrencies that actually becomes more decentralized over time. There is no inflation, the supply is capped at 133 million. This means that there is no financial competition from stakers and miners to get a larger share of coins or hash power. Instead, NANO uses ORV (open representative voting). This allows people to vote for nodes in order to give them the power to verify transactions. If nano ever became geographically centralized, everyone could simply vote for nodes in different regions. If a specific node was starting to gain way too much power over the network, people could easily change their vote to a smaller node. \n\n**Scalability**\n\nNANO is extremely scalable, because it is not limited by software. The transactions per second only depends on hardware. As more powerful nodes become integrated in the network, the TPS and confirmation times should drastically improve. Transaction times in 2017 were anywhere from 5 to 10 seconds. Now they take about 0.3 seconds.\n\n**Environmentally friendly**\n\nNANO is extremely energy efficient. \u201coperating at 7,000 transactions per second, the entire Nano network could be powered by a single wind turbine. Not only that, but it would take \u201cover 1 million transactions to use the equivalent energy of an LED light bulb.\u201d This is important as we move towards a green world.\n\nhttps://medium.com/@brunoerg/nano-is-green-d2f5cbf0e1d9\n\n\n**Deterministic Finality**\n\nMost cryptocurrencies require multiple confirmations before the transaction is fully completed. Instead, nano is confirmed instantly with just 1 confirmation. Once someone sends you nano, they cannot take it back. This makes it impossible for anyone to ever do a double spend, since the transaction is confirmed right away. \n\n**Spam Resistance**\n\nNANO has an update soon to be released, known as V22. This will likely be a permanent solution to the spam problems that have been experienced lately. It works by using an election scheduler. What this means, is that all transaction amounts will be put into 128 different categories. (0.1, 1, 10, 100, etc.) If a spammer were to send 0.1 nano back and forth, it would only effect the 0.1 category. Anyone sending transactions on the 127 different amounts would be unaffected. \n\nBut even than, spamming 1 of 128 categories will be difficult because of the new prioritization method. Blocks will be processed by the least recently used. An account that made a transaction a month ago will always have their transaction processed before the spammer that is spamming now."}, {"title": "JPMorgan Plans To Offer Bitcoin Fund To Wealthy", "score": 0, "url": "https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2021/jpmorgan-chase-to-offer-bitcoin-fund-to-wealthy-customers/", "selftext": ""}, {"title": "Anyone pull profits while still DCAing in?", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mz31c1/anyone_pull_profits_while_still_dcaing_in/", "selftext": "Is this stupid?

For every cryptocurrency and blockchain enthusiast, this is expected. Despite cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology gaining a whole lot of other use cases recently, the goal to replace the fiat system with decentralized payment solutions running on a distributed ledger still lives in the mind of every cryptocurrency enthusiast.\n\nYou probably got some cryptocurrencies on your wallet and you wish someday they are going to be the \u2018new cash\u2019, or at least they will be accepted by major stores. A good number of cryptocurrency projects have succeded in doing this. [Travala](https://www.travala.com/) provides cryptocurrency holders an avenue to book flights and travel to over three hundred location and pay via cryptocurrencies. Popular adult video website had also announced a \u2018crypto-only\u2019 subscription scheme after major e-payment firms withdrew their services from the platform.\n\nThe crypto space has endured a lifelong debate on the superiority of cryptographic tokens over the much older fiat system, an event likely to continue throughout its lifespan. But despite many blockchain projects making several breakthroughs in building a portable spend systems on the blockchain, cryptocurrencies are still very far from being the new cash.\n\nWell, from a basic view point, if cryptocurrencies are used in exchange for goods and services, then they are money\u2026at least in this particular instance. In real sense, this is a bit different from the proper definition of money. Other items such as rare metals, shopping vouchers, bank cheques (of course!) have been used in similar instance, but these are not cash\u2026in the real sense.\n\nBitcoin cash (SV and ABC) were forked from the original bitcoin core blockchain to create a portable means of everyday spend activities. Bitcoin was particularly created for a similar purpose. Contemporary crypto space makes it hard to see these tokens as cash, regardless of how much cryptocurrency enthusiasts dream of this. Cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange are more like mere vouchers with an intrinsic value.\n\nMajor difference between cryptocurrencies and vouchers in this case is the pronounced fluctuation in value of cryptocurrencies. A stable cryptocurrency used in exchange is more like vouchers, cryptocurrencies prone to price fluctuations are more like company shares\u2026but not close to cash in any case. This is unarguable if looked at closely.\n\nThe \u2018gold\u2019 reputation suits bitcoin more than \u2018cash\u2019. The value of Cash in essence is determined and backed by more generalized entities. The value of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are determined mainly by market dynamics and the progress of blockchain technology, something very similar to company shares and rare metals.\n\n\u2018Cash\u2019 reputation is a far reach for a virtual commodity whose value is highly volatile. Legal recognition of existing cryptocurrencies as cash is even a much harder task. Cryptocurrencies will need to undergo extreme modification to be considered as real cash. Universality, a very much preached feature of cryptocurrencies is a concept also seen in gold and other rare metals \u2013 the closest and real alternatives to \u2018cash\u2019 cryptocurrencies.\n\nCryptocurrencies serving as utility tokens of blockchain projects which solves some real-world problems or presents a new and more efficient way of handling real-world issue are clearly closer to achieving their goals. It is the very best application of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies serving as a store of value is more realistic.\n\nBringing in some aspects of blockchain technology into fintech and revolutionizing the financial system to incorporate some virtues of blockchain technology into the mainstream financial system will surely create a more efficient financial system. The fiat system may never die, but if blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies takes a healthier route and fixes some of its biggest issues, then they stand a chance of penetrating the mainstream financial system\u2026but not totally replacing fiat. Cryptocurrencies are very much different from fiat in mode of operation and replacing fiat with cryptocurrencies might just be a long-lasting illusion.\n\nMost Cryptocurrencies are more of utilities and securities than \u2018cash\u2019. Shifting the focus to building utilities on the blockchain and cryptocurrencies being the traditional tokens of these blockchains could benefit cryptocurrencies more than the \u2018cash\u2019 dreams. A number of regulatory moves and technological modifications of current blockchain technologies is required to develop cryptocurrencies closer to being used as cash. This surely changes the concept."}, {"title": "What are the \"If I bought $100 worth of ??? back then\" of today?", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mz2icp/what_are_the_if_i_bought_100_worth_of_back_then/", "selftext": "Everyone always talks about an opportunity they had years ago to buy BTC at 0.01, or 0.1, or $1, or $100 or whatever!

Why are we interested in using cryptocurrencies as a means of payment?", "score": 4, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mz0vc3/what_is_a_crypto_visa_card_why_are_we_interested/", "selftext": ">Basically, the world economy is based on the constant buying and selling of goods and services. **Money is continually moving from hand to hand from one place to another, generating wealth and promoting productive and entrepreneurial activity.** In the capitalist system in which we live, it is essential that there is fluidity in transactions so that the wheel does not stop turning.\n\nWe are used to the fact that the money that we handle in our day to day is the fiat currency of the country in which we reside or are passing through. Currently euros in the case of Spain, pounds in the United Kingdom, dollars in the United States (and many other territories) ... All these are the currencies that we use normally, whether in cash, in the form of coins and banknotes, or for and for some time by electronic means through credit or debit card payments.\n\n**On the other hand, there are also cryptocurrencies, or virtual currencies. Unlike fiduciaries, they do not depend on the country in which they are located, since they are not centralized, that is, they do not depend on any institution or authority that issues and regulates them. T**here's many applications that they have to be used through the network. But what if I told you that you can also use them in the \"real world\"? Do you want to know how? Keep reading!\n\n## Why we are interested in using cryptocurrencies as payment\n\nLet's start from a fundamental concept that many people find it a bit difficult to assimilate: cryptocurrencies are real money. The fact of not having physical representation and not taking up space in your wallet does not make them \"false\" or \"less valuable\". In fact, on the contrary, they have a number of advantages that common fiat money lacks.\n\nFor example, the decentralization to which we alluded implies that its value does not depend on the political ups and downs of the government of the day, but is determined solely by the use that consumers make of it. On the other hand, they are especially suitable for international operations, since the transfer of funds happens instantly and there is no need to deal with tedious and potentially expensive procedures such as currency exchange.\n\nIn addition, they are based on blockchain technology, which guarantees a maximum level of security: each operation carried out with them is recorded in a block in the chain, linked to both the previous and the next, which implies that no it can be modified without affecting the rest. This means that any transaction that is made is traceable and traceable, so the risk of scams and scams is minimized. But at the same time, purchases and sales are anonymous, as with cash, and privacy is guaranteed at all times.\n\nAll these advantages allow us to think that, without a doubt, we are facing the means of payment that will revolutionize the world monetary landscape in the near future. But unfortunately, although cryptocurrencies are more and more widespread and are being accepted in more places as a means of payment, we are still talking about a system that is not very well established in society, which is slowly opening a gap but still has a long way to go until its use is widespread. The same thing has happened with most groundbreaking innovations throughout history; the public is often reluctant to the new and rarely allows it to become an instant hit, but takes some getting used to.\n\n## Crypto VISA cards: cryptocurrencies in your day to day\n\nTo try to speed up the process and promote the transition towards the use of a more reliable and efficient currency, some cryptocurrencies, are beginning to implement a method that allows them to be used in everyday life as normal. The solution that has been designed to achieve this is the crypto VISA cards.\n\nA crypto VISA card is simply a card linked to an account that works with cryptocurrencies. The money with which you pay when using it is the one you have in your wallet in the form of virtual currency. For practical purposes, its form of use is exactly the same as if it had been issued by a commercial bank and worked with fiat currency.\n\nThe nuance is that, having the support and infrastructure of VISA, it can be used without problem in all businesses in the world that accept these cards. In the XXI century, we speak of the vast majority, in practically every corner of the planet and in almost any sector of activity. So with a crypto VISA card you can now use your cryptocurrencies to pay in more than 50 million businesses, both physical and online stores, as well as to receive payments.\n\nThe system is particularly beneficial if you often travel to countries where a different currency is used than your hometown, or if you are used to making purchases on foreign websites. The first thing you will notice is that the need, imposed by certain businesses, to have a bank account in the local currency disappears. In addition, you may have noticed that normally on these occasions it is customary to charge some commission for currency exchange, which can sometimes be quite significant. In this way the problem disappears, because you will pay directly with your crypto and you will not be charged any additional fee, but the exchange will be governed by the current price at that time.\n\nLove from the Little Venetia.

Cryptos like Ethereum have their own coins as well as a near endless list of other potential usages. ETH I believe is what has the potential to change the world.  Yet Bitcoin is 50,000+ per coin and Analysts are saying it may go over 100,000 and way beyond in the future, but I just don't understand why? In my mind if anything BTC will at some point drop while ETH will go up.  Completely open to any thoughts on this. I am legitimately looking for information, not to start an argument. \n\nMy second question is all the crypto-analysts I follow consistently use the state of Bitcoin to determine the state of altcoins.  This I also do not understand. They say things like \"Bitcoin is expected to go up so Cardano will also go up/down\" etc and I have no idea why these two separate technologies are intrinsically related.

No bueno coinsmart. According to support they do batches of transactions once a day. Very unbecoming of a crypto exchange.\n\n-A few weeks prior I attempted to send my ADA to yoroi and once again they transaction was backlogged 5 hours.

Check out NEO.\n\nThere are so many shit (scam) coins trending right now and it's very enticing for newcomers to jump aboard. It can also be very intimidating to look at CMC and try to find a gem in the \\~9,000 coins currently listed. This post is to share a project with you guys that is not really talked about in this sub all that much - NEO (formerly Antshares).\n\nBefore I move further - This is not a shill post. Buy NEO or not, that is not the purpose. The purpose is to try to counteract the Safeshit posts urging people to stay away from them. I feel like there are not enough informational posts for decent projects. We should be discussing good projects that bring something meaningful to this space. I believe NEO does just that.\n\n**Little history:** NEO began as Antshares in Feb of 2014, the brainchild of Da Hongfei and Erik Zhang, which markets itself as a Smart Economy, or the next iteration of the internet (Internet 3.0). NEO is an all-in-one solution. More on this later, but NEO can be likened to Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot, Cardano, Solana, and a few other platforms. If you are not familiar with these types of platforms, read a little bit about Ethereum and what it seeks to do.\n\n**Disclaimer**: Many platforms like this (or the sub community) tend to market themselves as \"Ethereum Killers\". NEO does not. NEO just seeks to offer an alternative solution and garner a portion of the developing market. If you must know, I hold both ETH and NEO and are bullish on both of them, specifically in the longer term. I believe there will not be a winner take all situation in crypto, especially not within our lifetime. Yahoo and Google are both doing fine right now, even though one has significantly much more name recognition.\n\n**What makes NEO unique and worth taking a look at?**\n\nOne of the most interesting characteristics of NEO (imo) is it's unique dual-token system. I imagine anyone reading this will be familiar with Ethereum and the concept of gas required to use the network (transaction fees, fees to develop and use the network). Ethereum is a single-token platform, meaning it only uses *one* token - Ether. Let's say you have 1 ETH that you want to send to someone. The fee (the gas) to send that 1 ETH will be deducted from that 1 ETH balance, very similar to Bitcoin transactions. \n\nI'm not going to discuss the rising gas fees in Ethereum here, I just wanted to illustrate this before moving forward.\n\nNEO uses a dual-token system, NEO and NEO GAS (GAS). NEO is a governance token, meaning owning some will give you voting rights in proposals to update the system. Holding NEO also gives you the right to claim GAS passively. GAS is the fuel used to power transactions and incentivize nodes to act honestly and secure the system.\n\n**NEO Token**\n\nWhat makes this token seriously unique is that it is *indivisible,* meaning that it can only be transacted in whole numbers (1 NEO, 2 NEO, etc.). It can be purchased in literally any fractional amount in exchanges but can only be sent on the network as whole numbers. There are about 70,000,000 tokens in circulation currently with a max supply of 100,000,000 that will ever exist. One *could* speculate that NEO could very well be one of the scarcest tokens in the space thus far. Even Bitcoin can be transacted in satoshis. \n\nProbably one of the most sought after properties of this token is the right to claim GAS passively. When a new block is added to the chain, GAS is generated and distributed proportionally to ALL NEO held in private wallets (even some exchanges will give you GAS for holding there, even for fractional NEO held). \n\n**NEO GAS Token**\n\nThis is the token that will be used to power transactions on the NEO network. Everything from sending NEO, exchanging NEO, building and running dApps will consume GAS. GAS is highly divisible and transactions typically cost around 0.001 GAS.\n\n**How is NEO Secured?**\n\nNEO uses an updated form of Proof of Stake called Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT). The technology of this protocol is expected to be able to handle thousands of transactions per second. I won't get too into detail here about the mechanics, but will link some supplemental resources should you wish to research further. As always, do not take the word of some random guy on the internet; do your own research! \n\n**Features of NEO**\n\n**One-Block Finality**\n\nThe dBFT consensus mechanism guarantees fast and efficient transaction finality in a single block.\n\n**Oracles**\n\nSome may be familiar with Chainlink, which markets itself as an oracle that gives access to off-chain data from the real-world. NEO blockchain does not require the use of external oracle solutions, as it has it's own built in to the platform.\n\n**NEOFS**\n\nBuilt within the network is a distributed data storage that focuses on scalability and privacy. This is similar to the goals of Filecoin or Siacoin.\n\n**Multi-language Smart Contracts**\n\nThis may be one of the most enticing features of NEO. NEO allows for smart contracts to be written in pretty much any open-source language, such as C#, Go, Python, Java, and Typescript. NEO also has it's own migration tool to bring already coded dApps into the NEO ecosystem. \n\nThis contrasts starkly to Ethereum, which only allows smart contracts to be written in it's native language, Solidity.\n\n**NEO Name Services**\n\nNEO has a decentralized .neo domain name service for the next generation of internet web apps.\n\n**Interoperability**\n\nThe Poly Network allows for smooth cross-chain interoperability with other sovereign chains like Ethereum and Binance Smart chain.\n\n**NEO ID**\n\nA self-soverign and decentralized identity solution standard. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Market Talk**\n\nI'm only adding this portion for the sake of completion. I don't want it to become a \"OMG NEO IS SO UNDERVALUED BUY IT NOW AND RESERVE YOUR SPOT ON THE ROCKET\". No. NEO is currently trading in the \\~$80-90 range and in my opinion still has room for growth. The main reason I am touching on this is because some people may say \"If NEO can only be transacted in whole numbers, that means I can only buy 1 or 2 or 3 NEO at a time, and it's too expensive for me\". This is **not** true. You can purchase NEO in pretty much any amount you like (barring any exchange restriction) and hold until you have enough to send on the network to a private wallet.\n\n**Where Can I Purchase NEO? Or GAS?**\n\nIn the US, buying NEO is a little tricky, because Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken do not list it. But Bittrex does and is a reasonably trustworthy exchange.\n\nI personally use [Kucoin.com](https://Kucoin.com). I just send crypto (BTC, LTC, XLM, or whatever is easily purchased on other exchanges with better fiat on-ramps and low fees to send). I just DCA into NEO and send it to my wallet (with no fee) once I reach integer amounts of NEO.\n\nYou can also buy it on [binance.com](https://binance.com) (Use a VPN). If this sounds too technical for you, just avoid it and use kucoin.\n\nPlease be careful if you purchase it on Voyager. I have nothing good to say about Voyager, but that has nothing to do with this warning. This warning is because Voyager does not allow you to send the NEO out to a private wallet, and this is a HUGE red flag for me. There is no proof you are actually owning the coin rather than an IOU. Plus, one of the main rewards for owning NEO is the right to claim GAS, which Voyager does not allow.\n\n**And Finally, NEO N3 Main Net Launch**\n\nCurrently N3 is in testnet and is scheduled to be released on it's own mainnet this summer. All of these features will be readily available for developers. This release could be it's own post, so I'll leave that for another time. Suffice it to say these are exciting times for a very ambitious project! \n\nIf you've made it this far, hopefully you are now interested in what NEO can bring to the crypto space and will continue to seek more information.

Market Capitalization is an equation:\n\n    Price * Circulating Supply = Market Cap\n\nSo the Dogecoin market cap right now is :\n\n    .27 USD * 129,348,760,640 = $35,631,212,394\n\n35,6 billion dollars. On coinmarketcap.com we can see that it is #7 when compared to other cryptos (just above Polka DOT, Uniswap, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash and Chainlink. Doge is just below Cardano, XRP, Binance Coin and ETH). As far as companies go, at 27 cent Doge is valued more than than some companies you might recognize, such as YUM! brands, Hilton Hotels, Orange (cellular network) and Hershey chocolate. Not bad for a crypto that doesn't have a marketing team, paid full time developers nor any paid professionals working on it's success. It doesn't have a CEO or any structure, it's development is decentralized and its current price rise is a testament to it's PEOPLE POWER. At this price it's currently bigger than the Serbian Dinar, Dominica Peso and the Bolivian Boliviano. But doge to a dollar is all but guaranteed, so lets look at that price:\n\n    1$ * 129,348,760,640 = 129,348,760,640 (that was easy math)\n\nSo at a 1$ doge would have roughly 130 billion dollar market cap. Unless other other cryptos do roughly a 3x gain, doge would be the #3 crypto, just below Ethereum. Eth's marketcap is 290 billion, so doge won't be able to unseat ETH until it goes to around 3$. But at one dollar doge's marketcap is more than some pretty big companies you may know: Dior, Charles Schwab, American Express, Blackrock and HBSC bank. You can see that a few of these companies are financial institutions and are prolly saying to yourself that doge is on par with being some type of financial institution because besides serving as a currency, it serves as a payment Network. Doge at a dollar also beats out Square, the payment network. Square has about 5000 employees who serve hundreds of millions of clients. At that price doge would be bigger than the Kuwaiti Dinar, Nigerian Niara and the the Argentine Peso. But Doge was about halfway to a dollar, so lets start to dream a bit and see what doge at 10$ or 100$ would look like:\n\n    10$ * 128,343,760,640 = 1,283,437,606,400\n\nSo at 10$ doge would have a 1,2 trillion dollar market cap which is about the size of Bitcoins. Since Doge is way better than BTC, this is totally possible. Even if BTC goes up more, doge would still, more than likely be able to secure the #2 spot with over a trillion dollar market cap. Only BTC has broken the trillion dollar market cap ceiling and if there is a crypto that can do it second, it's Doge. Eth would have to make it to 8,700 an ETH for it to break the trillion dollar barrier. Whats more likely, Doge to 10$ or ETH to 8,7k ? Not many companies have over a 1 Trillion dollar market cap, so at 10$ per doge it would surpass Facebook, Tesla and Berkshire Hathaway. At 1 Trillion doge surpasses all the payment networks: Visa's piddly 500 billion, get smoked. As far as FIAT goes, Doge at 10$ would surpass those currencies of Russia, Mexico and Saudi Arabia. At 11$ it would be worth more than all the silver in the world. But doge isn't stopping there. It will make it to 100$\n\n    100$ * 128,343,760,640 = 12,8838,376,064,000\n\nSo at 100$ per doge the market capitalization would be 12,8 trillion. It would be worth more than all the gold on the plant (11 trillion) and be worth more than any company in existence. Blowing Apple, Microsoft and google out of the water. As far as FIAT currencies go, doge at 100 would mean it's marketcap would be higher than that of the British pound, The Canadian Dollar, and the Swiss franc (Those are just a bunch of old stuffy bills with dead white one them)  Not bad for the doggy coin, no?\n\n**The haters will say that doge to 1$,10 or 100$ isn't possible.

I've also stumbled across a couple other posts in the past about how Crypto or Moon Farming had changed their lives, particularly in a developing country.

This post mostly just points out how it is not a representation of the amount of money in an asset.\n\nMarket Capitalization in Cryptocurrency is still severely misunderstood. Even by those who lash out at newcomers when they want to buy a cheap coin, ranting about the market cap. \n\nThere's a reason the formula for Market Capitalization in Crypto is generally structured the same way every time:\n\n>Market Capitalization = Price \\* Circulating Supply\n\nIt's because Market Capitalization is a byproduct of those two factors and not the other way around. There seems to be some wide misunderstanding that Market Cap represents the total amount of money that has flowed into an asset (\"Wow! People have spent $1T in total on Bitcoin.), when in reality it's nothing more than a very rough estimate, *if that*. In reality, if I bought $50B in Bitcoin right now, we would most likely *not* see the market cap move by $50B.\n\nTo understand why it's not a good estimate, you have to understand how prices are set. They're set by us. More specifically, they're set by the Bid and Ask spread ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-and-ask.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-and-ask.asp)), while exchanges simply provide us with the means of trading, and arbitrageurs keep each exchange at a similar rate.

For some reason, every single holder uses this technology and every single one of them come to agreement that will not sell Bitcoin at the market price of $60k, and instead ask for $100k per Bitcoin. For some reason, buyers are still willing to set bids as high as $100k.\n\nHere are two questions to sum up this post:\n\nWhat happens to the price of Bitcoin?\n\nThe Market Cap at $60k was \\~$1.2T, the market cap now at $100k is \\~$1.85T.

I hope this series generates insightful discussion, and helps us all understand the value of blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies.\n\nToday's paper is \"Understanding Managers\u2019 Reactions to Blockchain Technologies in the Supply Chain: The Reliable and Unbiased Software Agent\" by Falcone et al.

This includes supply chain systems, which necessitate strong interorganizational collaborations that historically have been problematic to encourage across multiple supply chain partners (\n    - Therefore, understanding how managers of supply chain partners perceive and support a new technology is a crucial first step toward understanding the implementation process management and its success\n    - However, understanding why supply chain partners accept or reject a technology has proven to be challenging\n    - While extant blockchain research primarily focuses on explaining what blockchain technology is, how it functions, and its proposed benefits (Gramoli [2017](#jbl12263-bib-0027); Aste et al. [2017](#jbl12263-bib-0007); Novo [2018](#jbl12263-bib-0060)), little is known about the specific aspects of blockchain that actually drive supply chain managers\u2019 willingness to adopt and use this technology due to its newness across industries. The proposed informational and transactional benefits of blockchain technologies are only fully realized when all participants in a network are utilizing the system to create a single record of the truth (Iansiti and Lakhani [2017](#jbl12263-bib-0037)).\n    - This new, shared, collaborative technology implementation has the potential to disrupt many traditional supply chain systems, as every trading partner\u2019s records are automatically updated and verified in the blockchain system and are viewable instantly by the other supply chain partners.\n    - Blockchain technologies introduce the ability for the system to potentially take on the role of traditional intermediaries (e.g., brokers, banks, import, and export agencies) as an unbiased, automated software agent (Nissen and Sengupta [2006](#jbl12263-bib-0059)) embedded within the supply chain network. \n    - This research takes a novel approach by examining whether __managers__ who are agents of supply chain partners exhibit similar perceptions of risk, trustworthiness and justice toward blockchain technologies, which may replace traditional organizations that often serve as intermediaries.\n    - There are two research questions that this paper aims to answer\n        -  __how blockchain technology features drive manager\u2019s willingness to adopt and use this emergent technology within the supply chain__\n        - __whether these perceptions of risk, trust, and justice mediate the relationship between the blockchain technology and manager\u2019s willingness to adopt and use the technology__ as in traditional supply chain relationships.\n- **Hypotheses**\n    - A distributed ledger lowers the probability, and magnitude of potential losses during information transmission by ensuring transaction records is immutable and accessible despite potential partner network outages. A supply chain partner falsifying or changing prior transactions is easily traced to a specific record due to embedded blockchain consensus mechanisms. Direct P2P communication between supply chain partners will grow visibility and transparency between those partners by increasing data access, ensuring transactional obligations, and providing ongoing monitoring of all network transactions.\n        - **Blockchain design features have a direct negative effect on manager's risk perceptions**\n    - Trustworthiness of a technology has two compnoents\n        - __competence__ : reflects the confidence in a technology to perform its intended behavior without flaws and inconsistencies\n        - __integrity__ : reflects whether the technology adheres to a set of accepted rules.\n        - **Blockchain design features promote manager's trustworthiness in technology**\n    - The perceived justice embedded within the supply chain network enables members to work together, share strategic goals, and succeed as a team without worrying about the opportunism, bias, and fraud that other partners in the network may exhibit. A successful supply chain is built on cooperation and collaboration, which is facilitated if partners have the same understanding and fairness of outcomes of the procedures involved in managing the relationship\n    - It has three components\n        - __procedural__: perceived fairness of policies and procedures associated with the distribution of outcomes and rewards\n        - __distributive__: content of fairness that focuses on the fairness of outcome distributions and partner contributions\n        - __interactional__: focuses on day-to-day communication and interaction processes that refer to the degree to which the partners perceive equality and fairness\n        - **Blockchain design features have a direct positive effect on managers' perception of justice**\n- **Testing The Hypotheses**\n    - The authors tested their hypotheses by using a scenario based survey experiment. \n    - Participants were business managers - 35% were supply chain managers, and 44% were information technology managers. \n    - Final sample was 141 respondents out of 258 original respondents (some failed manipulation checks, some did not complete the survey)\n- **Findings**\n    - **The authors found that the __competence__ part of trustworthiness and  __distributive justice __were significant factors that contributed to the managers willingness to use blockchains in supply chain management**\n- **Managerial Insights**\n    - The next big hurdle in the diffusion of blockchain technologies is managers\u2019 willingness to use blockchain as organizations and supply chains being to integrate this technology into their processes.\n    - Managers should be aware that blockchains may eventually function as the unbiased software agent once successfully integrated into the interactional processes, as it can autonomously standardize, monitor, and coordinate all the data and processes in the supply chains that traditional third parties and mediators may have served. Users of blockchain technologies will have to shift from trusting in a human behind the screen making decisions to trusting the algorithm and processes that are embedded into the blockchain technology.\n    - the success of a large, inter-organizational technology implementation may depend on the complexities of the communications process in sharing the features, benefits, and outcomes of using a specific technology, focusing on effective communication and the education of key design features of blockchain technology while reducing the potential bias of media hype in the market will facilitate the first step of a successful implementation.\n    - results indicate that to enhance such communications, managers need to understand the impacts that blockchain design features have on the trustworthiness and justice that an embedded software agent can provide over traditional technology designs. More specifically, an understanding of which mediating mechanisms that have been shown to be important in traditional B2B interactions (e.g., risk, trust, justice) is applicable in a blockchain context and which should be leveraged as talking points to encourage future use.\n    - This research presented the concept of blockchain technologies to nontechnical professionals through the discussion of its core features instead of pushing the __term__ blockchain, which may present biased perceptions due to the media coverage and hype around specific instances of blockchain implementations such as cryptocurrencies.\n    - The researchers introduced the notion of a software agent and two underlying features that, when combined, create blockchain technologies (DLT and P2P) and subsequently provide examples of how these features can lead to operational improvements (higher efficiency, consistency, and reachability) across supply chains. The discussion of these operational improvements at a feature level and the mechanisms through which they impact managers and supply chain agents\u2014instead of through the term blockchain, with its associated media bias\u2014may provide a more effective method for encouraging willingness to use.\n- **Limitations**\n    - This research looks at the outcomes of blockchain technology, as opposed to how blockchains works\n    - It is scenario based survey research. You cannot be absolutely sure that the participants can \"put themselves in the scenario\". There is imagination involved, and therefore this research may have issues with internal validity. \n    - Sample size was okay, but only 35% were Supply Chain managers. This might color the findings.\n- **TLDR; So What?**\n    - **To encourage blockchain adoption in supply chains, try to dissociate the technology from crypto currencies** : do this be reframing the technology in other terms.\n    - **promote the competence of the technology**\n    - **promote the distributive justice aspect of the technology, i.e. encourage people to see that the outcomes of adoption are proportional to the efforts that supply chain partners put in.**"}, {"title": "What is a good mining setup for a small scale miner?

For those who dont know, staking is basically delegating your ADA to a stake pool, and you earn interest as a result. Your crypto never leaves your wallet, and you can stop staking and move your funds at any time if you want to so it is a safe process. I wont go too deep into details but by staking you can earn between 4-6% every year, and you are paid every epoch (5 days).\n\nIm happy to announce that Im currently earning more money every 5 days by staking that my regular bank account makes me in one year.

Some exchanges offer LTO staking, but if you want to control your keys, then the wallet is your only option. There is no fancy app, just the website that seems to have been designed in the 90's. It does the job though and not having a app probably prevents selling..\n\nOnce you've created your wallet it's easy to start staking. Just click on the menu, and select 'Leasing'\n\nThen choose the pool you want to use and how much you want to stake. Note that you can have multiple leases to the same or different pools, so you if you transfer more funds to your wallet, just start a new lease for the new coins\n\n**What pool should I use?**\nPools , or lease nodes as they are called on the LTO Network, are where you can stake your coins if you don't want to run your own validator node. \n\nThe list of public lease nodes can be found on the LTO website, and here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R9OPQxW9dD9anq217ffm9sXINV_xKTNNaiHcY_eOWmw/edit#gid=0\n\nEach pool has its own rules and some advantages or disadvantages, but they all have the same APY. I've only used Stakely.io, which I've reviewed briefly below\n\n**How often are rewards payed out?**\n\nThis depends on the pool, it's generally around once a week, but some are done automatically so the rewards are always compounding \n\n**What are the fees?**\n\nThere's always a 1 LTO fee to start a lease and 1 LTO fee to withdraw. \n\n\n**What is the APY?**\n\nAround 6.3-7%, you can play with the rewards calculator here https://www.stakingrewards.com/calculator/lto-network\n\nWhen you stake your LTO you can choose what pool to join. I've only used one, the Stakely.io pool, which I'd definitely recommend. You can check out their website here https://stakely.io/lto-network-staking\n\nAdvantages of the pool:\n \n* Rewards automatically compound on the node, so there is no need to withdraw\n* Great Telegram bot that lets you check your rewards instantly and can be used to withdraw funds\n* Withdrawals are instant and users can trigger them whenever they want \n* If you have multiple leases, the bot will put them altogether and show you the overall rewards\n\nI'm sure there's loads of stuff I've missed, so if you have questions let me know and I will answer in the comments"}, {"title": "Only 1 day left until the etheros.io private sale starts!

Since everyone is different, each investor has a different way of taking profit, investing and making decisions, so I am not asking for a formula. I am asking for ideas and guidance. And before I hear \"just HODL, no profit\"... well, I can't. Short term speaking, I need to take some profit. Once my financial situation changes, my approach will be different.\n\nFrom my research I have read many times people saying \"when X coin pump 50%, I take out 15% of it\". And then adjust these values according to dips and pump. But how do you choose this percentage? Is it arbitrary, based on how one feels about it? Or mathematically speaking, there is a reason to choose one % over another? When do you decide a difference between reaching 15% or 20% increase, when both options are available? \n\nI have been into crypto since not long, but being a student in lockdown gave me so much time on my hand. I spent hours everyday researching all the other aspects of crypto, and I am loving it.

The question was about how to talk with a friend about moving ADA from exchange wallets into community wallets like Yoroi, and taking control of their delegation decisions.\n\nI had some notes as a long term investor...\n\nOur engagement with Cardano and more broadly cryptocurrency is not dissimilar to engagement with securities or any other asset classes. However, our engagement with intermediates in terms of purchasing and selling is different to the relationship of a broker. \n\nExchanges in cryptocurrency act like exchanges. They guide customers towards holding assets with the exchange indefinitely with limited flexibility. You get, if anything, exposure to their products alone. \n\nThis is not an optimal position for an investor. It is a double dependence. One, the security itself of your money held in account. Two, the choice of what investment products that money can be applied to.\n\nThe first dependence is not a difficult one to swallow. The second, however, is what concerns me the most. By narrowing investment product choice our opportunities for fiscal reward are likewise narrowed. This may impact either the bottom line or the ability of an investor to spread risk. Neither is optimal.\n\nI am purposefully cautious regarding who I work with as an investor (and you can see how [DAWN](https://www.opendawn.com/dawn) filters for investors who take a moment to read and calculate rather than hitting \u201cDelegate\u201d based on surface dynamics). The caution has paid me well over the years.\n\nFor an asset class like Cardano the optimal strategy is probably to purchase cheap (exchanges like Binance) and to delegate to pools positioning for long holding. Because of the nature of the ecosystem, there remains great flexibility to re-delegate at minimal cost. But the choice of delegation and re-delegation is important.\n\nIt would be hard to argue that any exchange has the same motivation as any investor. Rather, they are incentivized for customer capture, retention, and revenue maximization. Which is fine. But it\u2019s not the same as \u201cI am investing in this space with a long term perspective to grow wealth.\u201d\n\nIt is far better to *place* your investment based on your determination, and in the context of your strategy, than to be at the mercy of the determination of a third party with a different motive to your own."}, {"title": "Don't invest in coins you have no confidence in, just for the sake of diversification.", "score": 48, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mytyd7/dont_invest_in_coins_you_have_no_confidence_in/", "selftext": "If you don't know much about a coin or have any confidence in it, you'll most likely freak out and sell at the first sight of a dip.

If you buy some now and they become as expensive as Bitcoin you will be rich! Bitcoin also used to be cheap! Right?\n\nLol, nah, wrong, obviously. The thing is: coin price doesn't matter. At all. Because it is strongly affected by how many coins are in circulation. There are currently about 18,700,000 BTC in circulation, there will never be more than 21,000,000. But there are 660,000,000,000 BTT at the moment and there will be 990,000,000,000 at some point. The important figure is the market cap, which is\n\n**Market Cap =  Circulating Supply  X Coin Price**\n\nSo, for example, for BTC it would be  52,500 X 18,700,000, close to a trillion USD. So if we imagine BitTorrent becoming just as big as Bitcoin, how much would a single coin be worth? $1.50. So can't a single BTT be worth thousands of dollars, like BTC is? No, absolutely not. If 1 BTT would be worth 52,500, as 1 BTC currently is, its market cap once all the coins are in circulation would be 51,975,000,000,000,000. 52 quadrillion, or 52,000 trillion. The total amount of wealth in the world is about 300 trillion.\n\n**tl;dr:** Coin price is NOT a good indicator how much a coin can still grow. Check the market cap and compare it to other coins to see how much a coin would need to grow to be as big as another coin. [The Coin Perspective](https://thecoinperspective.com) is a great website to make these comparisons.

Never immediately go 100% of the money you have or want to invest into any form of investment. Instead keep reserve cash to buy more just in case the price drops.\n\nExample:\n\nLet's say Bitcoin's price is $50000. You have $50000 to invest. You have no other money to buy any more Bitcoin beyond your $50000. \n\nYou buy it.\n\nNow you have 1 BTC worth $50000. Tomorrow Bitcoin goes to 100,000$. Yay! You have doubled your cash. \n\nBut the likelihood of that happening is pretty small, at least within the next few weeks or month. \n\nIf you plan on buying and forgetting about the price of BTC for a few years even if it goes to 0 or hoping that it goes to $100,000, I want you to stop reading because this doesn't pertain to you. \n\n-----\n\nHowever what happens if Bitcoin drops? Let's to 25000? You just lost 50% of the value of your initial buy. And you have no more money to buy more Bitcoin because you love Bitcoin and you wish you could buy more but you can't. Because you went all in when it was at 50000$. \n\nWhat do you do?\n\nInstead of going in 100%, go in 50%. Or even 25%.\n\nBuy 25000 of BTC. If it goes to 100000$, your total investment will double to 50000$ + your 25000$ cash reserve will be $75000. Now you might say, \"I wish I had not done DCA and instead gone all in\".\n\n\nHowever if you look at the charts BTC or whatever coin or stock you buy can go in any direction at any time of the day.\n\nIf you slowly buy as the price fluctuates, the following will happen:\n\nLet's say you buy 25000 at 50000 and then another 25000 at 25000. Now you have 1.5 BTC. Your total cash value for BTC will be 37500$. \n\nNow you have 1.5 BTC.\n\nHad you gone all in at 50000$, right now two things would have happened: your investment will be worth 25000 and you will have to wait for BTC to go up 100% for you to make your initial investment back. **What if it never goes back to 50000?** Well if you DCA, you can lower your average price buy and be able to either minimize your losses or quickly regain your investment. \n\nBut since you have 1.5 BTC by dollar cost averaging, BTC needs to only go up 50% for you to make your money back.\n\nNow ask yourself, what is easier to do, BTC going up 50% or 100%?\n\nIf you DCA and end up with 1.5 BTC and the price of BTC recovers from 25000 to 50000, you will regain your investment **and**  make money. \n\n1.5x 50000  = 75000. \n\nThis is where it gets amazing.

At the time of writing, we are in a bull run. During bull runs, profit can easily be made: You invest (in a coin you researched thoroughly) and wait for your profit to grow. But what if the bull run turns into a bear market? In what assets should you invest? This is where stablecoins come into play.\n\n# Why stablecoins exist\n\nStablecoins have different functions. We will discuss two of them below.\n\n## Hedging against the volatility of the price of crypto coins\n\nOne of the main arguments against cryptocurrencies is that the price is too volatile. investors who are against crypto believe that crypto coins can therefore not be used in daily life.\n\nFortunately, stablecoins are here to counter that argument. Stablecoins can ensure that cryptocurrencies are accepted more quickly. It makes financial aspects like borrowing, saving and salary easier in the short term, at least that's the promise.\n\n## Hedging against price falls\n\nStablecoins are mainly used on cryptocurrency exchanges. It can be a way to hedge against exchange rate fluctuations. It works like this:\n\nSuppose the price of bitcoin is currently six thousand dollar. You expect the price to fall. At that time you can choose to exchange bitcoin for a stablecoin such as Tether. Will the exchange rate drop to five thousand dollar? Then you still have six thousand dollar in digital currency. If you expect bitcoin to rise again, you can then exchange the stablecoin for bitcoin again.\n\n# Types of stablecoins\n\nThere are many different types of stablecoins available to investors. below we discuss the most well-known stablecoins.\n\n## Tether\n\nThe first Tether tokens were released on October 6, 2014 as a layer to the bitcoin blockchain. Back then under the name RealCoin.\n\nTether is a cryptocurrency that reflects the value of the US dollar. The idea was to create a stable cryptocurrency that could be used as a digital dollar. With Tether investors can benefit from the advantages of blockchain technology, without the high price fluctuations that often prevent people from using, for example, bitcoin as a means of payment.\n\nMany exchanges offer USDT as a trading pair, allowing investors to buy many different cryptocurrencies directly with a currency that reflects the United States dollar (USD). Tether is often used as a kind of refuge for when things are going a bit less with, for example, the bitcoin or when the price fluctuations are once again gigantic.\n\nHowever, it should be emphasized that Tether is a centralized crypto coin. Although it works on the blockchain, not everyone can access the ledger. This means that investors cannot easily verify whether everything is going as promised. Instead, everyone is asked to have faith in the company behind the coin. This is quite ironic, because the whole idea of \u200b\u200bcryptocurrency was born precisely to solve the problem of centralization and trust.\n\nMany skeptics doubt whether Tether LTD actually has the same amount of dollars in their account as the amount tether coins that are in circulation. This doubt may have arisen due to a lack of transparency in tether. While the tether blockchain is public, Tether LTD's bank account is not.\n\nTether has announced that indeed they do not only have dollars in the bank account. They say they also use bitcoin and ether as collateral.\n\nThat doubt led to a disturbance in the force on October 15, 2018. The once so stable tether faltered because the price fell rapidly. The tether price dropped to 85 cents in a few hours and then recovered to a somewhat common price of 97 cents.\n\n## USDC\n\nUSDC, or USD Coin, is a stable coin. As the name might suggest, the digital currency is pegged to the US Dollar. One USDC is worth one dollar and vice versa. The currency is still very new: it can only be traded since the beginning of October 2018.\n\nWhen news came out that this new coin, a collaboration between Center (a crypto platform backed by Goldman Sachs, one of the largest US investment banks) and Coinbase, was available, the price rose equally significantly. On October 15, 2018, 1 USDC price was $ 1.11. The exchange rate has now stabilized again and has fluctuated around the dollar limit.\n\nThe USDC is fully backed by Dollars. That means that for every USDC in circulation, there is a physical dollar in stock at Circle (the company behind USD Coin). This reserve is reported regularly and transparently.\n\n## TUSD\n\nA relatively new digital currency is TUSD (TrueUSD). Simply put, this is the transparent version of USDT, at least according to the developers.\n\n1 TrueUSD equals 1 US dollar in this case too. However, unlike Tether (USDT), TrueUSD (TUSD) is less centralized. The platform behind the coin (the TrustToken asset tokenization platform) spreads the dollars to cover the amount of TUSD in circulation across multiple trust companies that have signed escrow agreements. Moreover, TUSD is more transparent by showing what is happening and where by means of statements. Each bill shows what is on the table, leaving no doubt about how much dollar is present.\n\n## DAI\n\nMakerDAO (MKR), the platform behind USD stablecoind DAI, uses the Ethereum blockchain, allowing the Dai stablecoin to be fully inspected by anyone and eliminating the need for a central organization to verify transactions. Dai is therefore also seen as a decentralized alternative to the centralized Tether.\n\nMKR is a cryptocurrency that is built on the Ethereum blockchain. Its purpose is to stabilize the value of DAI through smart contracts called Collateralized Debt Positions (CDP). When the smart contract life ends, the MKR token is gone. MKR can be sent and received through any Ethereum account or smart contract programmed to use the MKR transfer function. It is more stable than most currencies in the market because of the way it is valued.\n\nDai is pegged to the US dollar, which means that 1 DAI = US $1. The currency is managed autonomously through smart contracts that adapt and respond to market dynamics, ensuring that the currency is tied to the USD. In this way, it provides traders with stability regardless of the market condition.\n\nThe Dai coins are therefore stable and linked to the USD. On the other hand, the MKR token is free to move in price and increases in value in accordance with an increase in usage. You can use MKR to pay for the costs incurred on CDPs that generate Dai in the Maker system, and as the demand for Dai and CDPs increases, so should the demand for MKR. In addition, when stability costs are paid with MKR, the issued MKR is permanently destroyed. This decreases the overall MKR supply, increasing its value.\n\n## PAXG\n\nPax Gold is the first digital asset to be backed by physical gold bars. PAX Gold is a Paxos Standard Token from the Paxos Trust Company in America.\n\nThe design is based on the ERC-20 token protocol of the Ethereum platform. This gold-backed token combines all the benefits of a crypto asset and gold on account without any storage fees. In fact, PAX Gold resolves a contradiction in the gold market: being able to own physical and share and trade gold with ease.\n\nPAX Gold tokens represent 1/400 part of a numbered gold bar. It is a 400 oz tokenized gold bar certified by the LBMA (certified London Good Delivery bars). Vault storage and security is provided by Brink's in London. PAX Gold can be traded instantly and cheaply 24 \u00d7 7 on the Ethereum blockchain. It is also divisible to 18 decimal places making it accessible to everyone.\n\n# Finals words\n\nStablecoins offer an excellent opportunity to hedge against volatile or bear markets. It is up to the investors to choose which stablecoin they want to invest in. One thing is sure: the crypto market offers plenty of choice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Do you now the difference between Proof of Work and Proof of Stake?

Now let\u2019s unpack that in the context of a crypto portfolio rather than a broadly diversified portfolio.\n\nA few things to get started:\n\n(1) know your risk\n\n(2) contextualize your exposure \n\n(3) hedge intelligently\n\nFirst, acknowledge that you are in a new asset class and the implications this brings. Things are going to go up and down a lot more than in securities, and that includes regarding a 30% adjustment with the same type of reaction as an 8% drop on NYSE. Painful but part of the path.\n\nSecond, given the above, understand what this means for your resources on the line. If crypto is 100% of your savings, you have serious exposure. If it is 10% you don\u2019t. You need to be super clear about this. It should inform everything you do next.\n\nThird, hedge your bets based on the above by understanding the specific assets within your reach. BTC has very different implications to ETH, and it is different again for ADA or ALGO. If you place more than 50% into one asset, and if that sum is an important percentage of your savings, you are moving dangerously close to the land of speculation.\n\nAs discussed regarding a [cross-asset diversified portfolio](https://np.reddit.com/r/opendawn/comments/my3cox/diversification_of_a_portfolio/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), you want to cut across value and growth. It may be as simple as electing to hold 1/3 each BTC, ETH and ADA, or more nuanced because on certain priorities.\n\nExamples of priorities that may come into play are:\n\n(A) fundamentals analysis \n\n(B) sustainability analysis \n\nWe don\u2019t have time to go into depth here, but a few observations immediately come to mind. \n\nBTC is basically worth something because people agree it is worth something. Thus, it is very close to a speculative asset even with an optimistic analysis, and has limited foundational strength.\n\nETH has the same belief as BTC but also provides a platform for smart contracts that is actively used by a diverse range of parties. It appears to have a more solid foundation and therefore may have better price resilience.\n\nADA has a stronger technical foundation than BTC or ETH, and presents a significant forward-looking opportunity. However, it is late to the smart contract game, and it is only after the August deployment that the *implementation* of its solid foundation will shake out.\n\nYou may read the above and immediately think: \u201cI guess I\u2019m going 25% BTC, 37.5% ETH and 37.5% ADA.\u201d And it would be hard to argue that\u2019s a bad hedge.\n\nOf course, you may also decide *not* to hedge until your portfolio value reaches a certain level, either as a percentage of crypto alone, or as a total of your investments and savings. \n\nAs always, you need to make an individual assessment rather than follow a blanket statement.\n\nIf you want to dig into details and share notes with other long term investors, just ping me. \u263a\ufe0f"}, {"title": "Crashes are raindrops telling you sunshine doesn't exist.

The idea that truly owning your currency is something that shouldn't be passed up. Generally, big banks and governments around the world control the economy and the money flowing in and out of it. With this being said, you never truly \"own\" your money. This is where decentralization comes into action. Having a decentralized network allows you to have full control over your money and even allows you to earn more interest in certain cryptos via staking (Algorand, VeChain, Ethereum 2, etc) than you would if you held your money in a bank's savings account.\n\nDecentralization is made possible via blockchain and today we have multiple blockchains with certain blockchains like Ethereum aiming to be general purpose such that anyone can come and build any usecase on it. Here, developers can launch their own financial protocols and platforms that are programmed to run a specific way from the beginning and heavily coded and encrypted. Coins and Tokens are bought, sold, and traded amongst one another without having to rely on a bank or government to approve the transaction. This gives everyone with an internet connection (to perform these tasks) the freedom to exchange cryptocurrencies with anyone around the world.\n\nWhile you do have to pay a fee to exchange or transfer coins and tokens on the blockchain, the end-goal is to have these fees be small enough to make trading worth it. Fees differ in price from crypto to crypto and are generally based on the total amount of traffic occurring on the blockchain, so they may change in price with each transaction. With the transparency in decentralization and the way blockchain technology works, at least you will know how much the fee will be upfront without having to worry about extra surcharges or \"fine-print\" hidden fees. The blockchain will work exactly to code and will not waiver for any individual.\n\nYou ever hear of a financial institution being hacked? [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_breaches) is current list of just that happening. Your precious, hard-earned money is heavily encrypted in a decentralized blockchain system. Given that each transaction has a unique code and record that must be verified and stored by other nodes on the blockchain, this makes hacking into the blockchain extremely difficult. While nothing is ever impossible, the increased transparency of each transaction on the blockchain gives the individual full confidence that their money is secured within their crypto wallet. Yes, a crypto wallet, because that is the most secure way to hold onto your cryptos. It's the safest way because that is when you truly own your crypto keys and can do as you please with them.  Yes, you should probably get your coins and tokens off your exchange wallet as soon as possible. Check out [this article](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/4/23/turkey-crypto-exchange-probe-62-arrested-ceo-on-the-run#:~:text=Sixty-two%20people%20have%20been,Albanian%20capital%20Tirana%20on%20Tuesday.) about a crypto exchange CEO \"vanishing\" after stealing over $2 Billion worth of investor funds. You probably don't want that happening to you!\n\nLooking forward, what does decentralization mean for us, the everyday individual? I think it means the future. Decentralization has the power to completely overthrow our traditional methods of conducting transactions. It gives everyone who owns a decentralized currency (crypto) the power and freedom to own and control their own finances with complete finality with the use of blockchains... all over the world.  \n\n### What does decentralization mean to you?"}, {"title": "Binance to launch Microstrategy, Apple, and Microsoft stock tokens", "score": 9, "url": "https://cryptonewsexperts.com/binance-to-launch-microstrategy-apple-and-microsoft-stock-tokens/", "selftext": ""}, {"title": "Reminder: Uniswap (UNI) v3 upgrade launches on May 5th w/ Optimism deployment mid-May!", "score": 13, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/myqwxd/reminder_uniswap_uni_v3_upgrade_launches_on_may/", "selftext": "[https://www.thestreet.com/crypto/ethereum/decentralized-exchange-giant-uniswap-unveils-key-upgrade#:\\~:text=The%20update%2C%20known%20as%20Uniswap,in%20the%20middle%20of%20May](https://www.thestreet.com/crypto/ethereum/decentralized-exchange-giant-uniswap-unveils-key-upgrade#:~:text=The%20update%2C%20known%20as%20Uniswap,in%20the%20middle%20of%20May)\n\nThe update, known as **Uniswap v3, is set to launch May 5**.

In contrast the Algorand wallet gives you around 6% apy for its reward system.\n\nThis means that the exchanges can hold everyone\u2019s ALGOs and make quite the pretty penny for it. Of course if you don\u2019t want this to happen, you can transfer it off exchange or transfer it to a different exchange that is more inclined to give the users what they deserve.\n\nAnyways, gradually APY rewards for Algorand will diminish as the supply nears full distribution. In the coming months there will be a network upgrade that rewards users for participating in governance on the blockchain. This will eventually replace the current apy system where exchanges can reap the rewards of Algorand while doing nothing for the network in return. What this means is that users can be rewarded double digit apy for voting on network upgrades and decisions surrounding the Algorand ecosystem.\n\nThis is a great opportunity for those of you who believe in Algorand.\n\nTL;DR Governance rewards soon to replace current apy system on Algorand"}, {"title": "Adoption of new technologies isnt always a straight line up!

It most notably does not say when a good time to buy is, just when to sell. The year 2014 had two crosses for its two local tops within a single bull-run, so selling at the first top and not buying back in again would've left you in worse spot than if you just HODL'd. These two local tops in 2014 along with the third in 2017 were used to create this indicator.

At the moment, they couldn't be much more public with who they are.\n* The burn wallet (the one showing with like 49% of the total tokens), is for burned tokens. Burning means that the tokens are gone forever, and are inaccessible for use in any capacity (even by the dev team).\n* The currency is not infinite, but instead has a constantly diminishing supply. It started at 1 quadrillion tokens, and since release has burned a total of 410 trillion (and counting) tokens!\n* Each transaction has a 10% fee associated with it, 5% is burned permanently, and the other 5% is redistributed to the liquidity pool and the people holding SafeMoon.\n* The devs plan to stop burning coins at some point (as low as 25 trillion coins, for example), to ensure a constant supply of tokens remains available.\n* The liquidity pool *is* available to the dev team, and to show the community how serious they were, they decided to lock away $250 million of it away for four (4) years time. \n\nWith each passing day, I personally feel it is far less likely that SafeMoon could be a scam or a 'rug pull', as many would say they believe it is. With how well known the devs are, at this point, it would completely ruin their lives. That being said, I do believe that this token actually has quite a bit of potential.\n\nMany of you likely saw their Wednesday AMA, where the entire dev team had gone days without sleep, and Thomas (the dev at a crypto/hacker convention) was seen as being unprofessional. While many people agreed it seemed unprofessional, they immediately turned things around with a personal AMA from John that same night addressing community concerns. In fact, the crypto/hacker convention even had some key things in it, such as Mandala's CEO personally saying that Mandala would be listing SafeMoon in the near future. \n\nTheir most recent AMA today was absolutely fantastic. Some key points were brought to light, such as future plans and teases at big projects that they have in store.\n\n* CertiK Audit, almost completed, and confirmed by CertiK themselves on twitter that they are in the process of working on it: [https://www.certik.org/projects/safemoon](https://www.certik.org/projects/safemoon)\n* More new exchanges in the works (upwards of five in the coming week, from previous news as well).\n* Constant talks with other exchanges while developing relations and working on getting SafeMoon listed.\n* Operation Pheonix (intentionally mispelled, per the CEO), where he stated \"SafeMoon will be the fuel for the Freedom of the Unbanked.\"\n   * This is the 'Endgame' for SafeMoon, as the CEO would say, and they are very secretive about what it could entail.\n* The SafeMoon exchange is almost fully funded, and will feature the same tokenomics as SafeMoon (fee and redistribution) for every Crypto Currency that is listed on their exchange.\n   * Example, if you were holding bitcoin and people were trading/selling Bitcoin on the SafeMoon exchange, holders would be earning free bitcoin from the redistribution.\n   * Timeline of around 6 months from when it is funded.\n\nNow, I want to be clear. *I'm not saying you should go and buy SafeMoon.* I believe each person should do their own research around a Crypto (especially around a Crypto), and come to their own decisions based on the available information. What I *am* looking for is a reasonable discussion, and arguments around why someone believes that it's a 'scam/ponzi/etc', even with all of the recent developments around the token.\n\nI know enough about this subreddit to know I'll probably be downvoted to the gates of Oblivion, but I hope to wake up to some interesting arguments or comments, and I can't wait to read any thoughts that you personally have!

You don't have projects reporting 10ks, or 10Qs, you don't know how much money they make, or lose. There is 0 transparency. So, the only thing the market cap of a coin tells you is how much all the coins in circulation are worth (last spot trading price x circulating supply). That's it. The price determines the market cap, not the other way around. The only thing that determines the price of a coin is simple supply vs demand. As long as more people keep buying a certain coin it does not matter how much people pour into it. Which brings me to the next point:\n\nThe market cap of a coin =/= the amount of money poured into that coin. This is another thing that infuriates me, and I see it among other Crypto Youtubers which makes it even worse for new people who are starting (not surprising, since most Crypto Youtubers are grifters and the lowest life form).\n\nFor example, If you have a coin that is $100 market cap, and is worth $1 per coin, that means there are about 100 coins circulating. If there are way more buyers than sellers, there is more demand than supply, and if someone were to pay say $2 per coin ($1 above its market price), they would raise the market cap of that coin by another $100. So essentially, the market cap went up by $100, even though we only poured in $2 into the system. \n\nThe next time you see smug Reddit threads and Crypto Youtubers say dumb misleading statements like \"BtC PaSsEd CoCa CoLa iN mArKeT CaP\" just laugh at them and down vote their content.\n\nAlso P.S unrelated pet peeve: price going up =/= adoption."}, {"title": "This is not a bear market.

That has led international funds such as Morgan Stanley, or the investment manager BlackRock to express their interest in buying bitcoin as a measure to mitigate possible risks of the trade war.\n\nIf you have been hearing about this market and you are in Venezuela or Colombia, perhaps you have learned that for little money you can have a fraction of this asset since each bitcoin is divided into 100 million fractions, known as satoshis, in tribute to Satoshi Nakamoto, who is credited with creating the digital currency. Although ***it remains a mystery to know if it was he or a group of people who gave life to bitcoin, the truth is that the cryptocurrency rises and arouses more interest in Colombia and Latin America***. According to Alejandro Beltr\u00e1n, Country Manager of [Buda.com](https://Buda.com), one of the global cryptocurrency trading platforms, it is not surprising that Colombia and Venezuela, due to their immigration status, appear in a ranking that measured the adoption of bitcoin in the world.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------*Rank of individual weighted metrics feeding into index*\n\n|Country|Score|Rank|On-Chain Value Received|On-chain retail value received|Number of on-chain deposits|P2P Exchange trade Volume|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Ukraine|1|1|4|4|7|11|\n|Russia|0.931|2|7|8|5|9|\n|Venezuela|0.799|3|19|14|15|2|\n|China|0.672|4|1|1|85|53|\n|Kenya|0.645|5|37|11|57|1|\n|United States of America|0.627|6|5|6|39|16|\n|South Africa|0.526|7|12|9|41|10|\n|Nigeria|0.459|8|14|7|112|3|\n|Colombia|0.444|9|25|18|61|4|\n|Vietnam|0.443|10|2|2|44|81|\n\nIn that list, prepared by the firm Chainalysis, Venezuela is third and Colombia is ninth in the world among 154 countries with the most adoption of cryptocurrencies. Ukraine and Russia occupy the first two positions, while Afghanistan, Algeria or Cape Verde do not have any activity in this market.\n\nThis situation is due to the fact that developing countries have a high activity of base cryptocurrencies. Venezuela represents an excellent example of what drives the adoption of cryptocurrencies in developing countries and how citizens use it to mitigate economic instability.\n\n\u201cAs we discuss in depth later in the report, our data shows that Venezuelans use cryptocurrencies more when the country's native fiat currency is losing value due to inflation, suggesting that Venezuelans turn to cryptocurrencies to preserve savings. That they might otherwise lose\u201d the report says.\n\nThis pattern is also seen in other Latin American countries, as well as in Africa, East Asia, and elsewhere.\n\nSo... **What to do if you want to invest?**\n\n* Get informed very well\n\nLike any investor, the information is what counts. Before putting the money in a company, it is important to find reviews on Google (the one that knows everything) and if you have doubts, put the word 'scam' or 'fraud' next to the name of who is offering the investment. Example:\n\nOn Google: \u2018Pepito P\u00e9rez bitcoin scam\u2019\n\nIf negative results come out, it is best to ignore the offer.\n\n* Invest only if you understand very well\n\nOne of the great obstacles of bitcoin, which for connoisseurs is the great advantage, is that it is not subject to a tangible investment and the price rises or falls, depending only on market announcements, supply and demand. There is not a company behind or an authority in the world to endorse. So the investor must understand the risks very well and what he is buying when depositing his money.\n\n* Don't risk house money or education\n\nOnly allocate for this investment the available money that you have from a surplus or that you are sure that you may lose it, if it is the case of your first investment and you do not understand its price changes very well. In the market, everything that goes up goes down again and bitcoin has been constantly increasing for a year, but in 2018 and 2019 it had a crash that raised concerns about its continuity. The truth is that this investment has huge price fluctuations that test the nerves of the most experienced investors. So, if you want to participate in that market, don't gamble with money destined for a goal like a house or a pension. Do it with resources that if you lose, they will not cost you much in the budget.\n\nFeel free to add more things that will help people jump on this train. Greetings from Little Venetia.

I\u2019m going through my trades (for taxes) and damn there is a lot to reflect on. I Initially went heavy on ETH and then I spread out some money on alt coins. I day traded like crazy with alt coins, taking loses in hopes of striking it rich. I was up about 33% and feeling invincible. Then I hit my first major dip (at least I thought at the time) in late January. I sold most of my crypto (at a profit) and it turned out to be a blip. Bought back in right away at a loss. Then a legit dip occurred in early February, sold most of my crypto which wasn\u2019t a terrible move as it really crashed compared to my entry price, but at this point I lost all of my gains and was back to zero. I bought back in after and limited my altcoin (primarily BTC, ETH, LINK,  and a splash of ADA). Having now a real perspective on a real dip (I get it could get worse than I\u2019ve ever seen like in 2017) I\u2019ve HODL since then and just buy more on dips. With that said I\u2019m still below my initial gains in late January even though prices are way up. My reflection isn\u2019t that you should always HODL but when your new you don\u2019t have the real life experience to understand when it is the peak or bottom to make smart trades. In the end I would have made so much more money if I had just HODL. After 5 months and experiencing some reasonable dips and pumps I feel more comfortable and confident in making some trades to sell high and buy the dip, but i only gamble a small fraction of my crypto with that.\n\nEdit based on initial comments:\nAlways keep in mind HODLing is easier the earlier you get in and have a bigger profit margin. Yes I would be up more had I never initially sold in early February but at the time the dip was big enough that I may go negative on my investment and at the time I couldn\u2019t accept that after being up so much.

I am going to look at the currencies themselves, the blockchain, and the recently popular NFTs.\n\nNow, I have to begin with the same disclosures you always hear about however, I also have some new ones.\n\nThere is no financial advice and I am not a professional in this sector. But I have to say that I am also relatively new to this world and this is all speculation. I know some history and have very much enjoyed researching the possibilities surrounding cryptocurrency.\n\n# Cryptocurrency\n\nLet us start with the currencies themselves. These can be world-changing in many regards. And I feel as if we know these. Every day there are stories about how someone is pulling themselves out of poverty, donating food, paying off a house, or shaking off the shackles of a corrupt government. But what currencies will we be using in the next few years, decades, and beyond? It is hard to say, for millennia the currency of the world was gold. Even until recent history many currencies were backed by gold, the US abandoned it in 1973. The only other \u2018recent\u2019 currency adoption has been the Euro. This took time, a quick timeline shows how hard it has been to adopt:\n\n1992: Maastricht Treaty outlines obligations for countries to adopt the Euro\n\n1999: the first 11 countries adopt the Euro\n\n2020: 19 countries adopt the Euro\n\nThis is a physical currency like nearly everyone is familiar with and it still took seven years for the agreed terms to be accepted [by 11 countries and 28 years for 19 countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_euro) to adopt a physical currency. It is a slow and aggravating process to have nations agree on anything. I assume most of you do not want a political discourse, so I will leave it at that.\n\nBut if it took this long for a group of nations to adopt a currency, how long would it take for them to agree to a cryptocurrency? Would they all accept one currency over all others as supreme? Who knows and probably not. As much as it pains me to say this, I can see bitcoin becoming akin to gold.\n\nIt is the standard, it is what backs most currencies, and it is trusted. But, like gold, it will eventually be relegated to the sidelines and marginalized as progress moves ever forward. To truly have a global currency one will be created to satisfy most demands and so that all will adopt together, rather than many countries adopting one country\u2019s currency.\n\nI highly doubt that any of us will ever see this. And that saddens me much like knowing I will never be able to travel beyond this solar system or see wars forever ended. I console myself with knowing that I am living, witnessing, and participating in history. Most all of us saw the birth of cryptocurrencies, something that will be studied with great fervor in the future. Know that what you invest in, promote, and create could dramatically affect the future of the world.\n\n# Blockchain\n\nOh, the infinite uses of a system that can track data and is self-regulated by any number of independent users not beholden to one another.\n\nHonestly, we can theorize innumerable uses for a system like blockchain. But let us look at one that has been very popular in the news and dominating Reddit for a couple of months. Stocks. Now again, I am no expert but this has a good chance to dramatically reduce fraud if implemented and until institutions find a weakness. Within the stock market you, as a consumer, never own an actual stock certificate. You own an IOU while a master copy sits in a master vault owned by Cede & co. There was a [great write-up](https://np.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mvk5dv/a_house_of_cards_part_1/) about this in another popular subreddit. An article was highlighted in that write-up that asked if blockchain could solve this system. The article was written in 2016. This is not a new idea. But institutions are warry to change from a system that is extremely profitable for them.\n\nImplementing a blockchain system or blockchain-like system to track stocks would eliminate many cases of fraud and manipulation. Essentially making sure that people are not lying and that people are only selling available shares.\n\nHowever, there have been next to [no updates on](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericervin/2018/08/16/blockchain-technology-set-to-revolutionize-global-stock-trading/?sh=15b5681e4e56) this for [quite some time](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/blockchain-technology-blockchain-stock-market-revolution/). People have proposed integrating blockchain technology into the market to help regulate ledgers, but it has not amounted to much lately. And it is easy to see why: less money for those who benefit from the current system. Unfortunately, I can see blockchain only being implemented through one of two ways: massive public outcry or complete crash akin to 2008. Either one of these would cause a great deal of turmoil within the financial sector. People also might not trust a system they do not understand. I do not blame them. The odds are stacked against blockchain, but it could be a revolutionary technology if integrated.\n\n# NFT\n\nNon-fundible token, non-fudgible ticket, non-fungible token, NFT. This excited me more than the other two. And I am aware I am in the minority. I am aware that you cannot have NFTs without blockchain. This is just coming into the public\u2019s view lately with the art being sold. [But it was created in 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token#History)and has been slowly building from there. In case you do not understand an NFT is something that signifies sole ownership of a digital asset whether it be a picture, song, or document. And while the uses so far have been quirky and somewhat misunderstood there is great potential for the blockchain-backed digital authority of ownership. Nike has already patented [CryptoKicks](https://thenextweb.com/news/nike-blockchain-sneakers-cryptokick-patent) which helps authenticate sneakers.\n\nFor those not in the sneaker world, knock-offs, replicas, and fakes are a huge issue. But there are several uses available to NFTs and once we can couple them with a physical object, the opportunities only abound exponentially. I am excited about things such as NFTs for deeds to houses, titles to cars, birth certificates, and other common documents. But I am going to take you into an area near to my interests.\n\nI think NFTs could revolutionize the medical world in a way I can only dream about. Every person has a unique genetic makeup, it is you and only you.\n\nThe only exception is identical siblings. Within this genetic makeup, we can learn unbelievable things about a person. We are learning how to \u2018interpret\u2019 genetics every day. Things like [the BRCA gene](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/brca-fact-sheet) for breast cancer and [CYP2C19 not metabolizing medications as well as other variants](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.119.007811). We may be able to see every health pitfall and probable issue by looking at a person\u2019s genes. It is also completely possible that we will be able to find the best possible treatments, medications, and options by looking at genetics. The first step for an individual would be getting their genome sequenced. But who owns that sequence? We already have issues with companies like 23 and me.\n\nThis is you. In a way that a social security number or driver's license number could never be. Here is where NFTs come into play. If we could make NFTs out of these sequences then we could protect people very essence unlike ever before. Who owns the genetic property is a budding realm of ethical debate that is ever-evolving the more we learn. People fear their genome being used for nefarious purposes or as a method of discrimination, let alone the devastation of losing control of this information.\n\nThis advancement is something that I think I will be alive for and that excites me. Knowing how history plays out means that it will evolve into something I cannot begin to fathom.\n\nI hope you have enjoyed reading this. I look forward to it dying in new, errors pointed out, and fallacies uncovered. I welcome corrections, honestly. I am acutely aware of how little I know and am actively working to remedy that. But whatever happens to this, it has been fun to layout and to share my thoughts.\n\nThank you all,\n\nMrZahn"}, {"title": "Largest satellite television operator in Venezuela accepts Bitcoin", "score": 17, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/myiee5/largest_satellite_television_operator_in/", "selftext": "SimpleTV, the largest satellite television operator in Venezuela, now accepts payments with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

If anyone can help him, please reply to this post so he can engage in a discussion with you. Thanks in advance.\n\n**So here is his story and his corresponding questions:**\n\n''I'm considering putting some of my money to work in the world of defi and have been doing research, but I wanted to source some opinions here so I have some more ideas and jumping off points for further investigation. As the title implies, I'm curious how others manage risk specifically within the context of crypto interest-bearing/lending accounts.\n\nThe first thing that sticks out to me (and a lot of people new to this stuff) is how volatile the prices can be when you're comparing a specific coin to USD. It doesn't matter if I can get some high percentage of interest on some trash coin that's inevitably headed toward 0. Even for coins that are more mainstream, the interest/rewards are effectively nullified if the price drops. If you're bullish on a specific coin, I can obviously see how this would compound your gains, but I'm simply noting the high amount of risk associated with the current volatility. I imagine this will subside over time, but for now it remains a reality.\n\nWith this in mind, I started looking into Stablecoins. With these, I can trust that the price will remain around 1 USD barring any fundamental change, hack, or issue. I can use platforms like Celsius, BlockFI, or Nexo (and many others) to hold a stablecoin balance and generate interest with no additional effort required from my side. I lose the potential for the coin to moon, but with interest rates at 10%+ for many stablecoins at these places, that's not a huge concern of mine and I'd rather eliminate an entire risk factor if I'm already collecting gains that large.\n\nAt this point I have to acknowledge that these platforms can only offer interest rates like that because they are lending your coins out to others, and that this would essentially be a high-risk, high-reward savings account since none of it is FDIC insured. In some sort of crypto black swan event, it's likely that many of these loans default, the collateral tanks, and the platforms are unable to pay back those who were offering their assets as a supply. I believe we can do a few things to mitigate our risk against these events, but each comes with tradeoffs, mostly boiling down to yield limitations and security.\n\n* Likely the most important - We can research and decide which platform(s) (in our opinion) have the safest risk-policy for lending and security.\n   * Scams are bad, but even legitimate platforms do sometimes take on increased levels of risk to offer higher yields. The risk of loans falling through is passed down to you\n* We can diversify which platforms we hold our money in.\n   * As a quick example - If I have half my money at BlockFI and half at Celsius and BlockFI blows up, there's a chance that Celsius doesn't. Since we kept half of our money at each, we didn't lose it all.\n   * An interesting question with this one is how much do you diversify? Each additional platform you hold funds in directly goes against our first point since the 3rd platform you add would theoretically be the one you feel the 3rd most confident in security/risk-wise.\n* We can also diversify which stablecoins we are using.\n   * Regardless of the platform(s) I'm using, if I have half my money in DAI collecting interest and half in USDC collecting interest, if DAI has some major bug/exploit come out, only half of my money is exposed to the issue.\n   * A similar question can be posed here about how much you would want to diversify in this respect since each additional coin you add means you're lowering your effective yield (assuming you'd start with the stablecoin that offered the highest yield within your platform(s) of choice, then second highest, and so on and so forth).''\n\n''Is there any major risk-mitigation that I can do that I'm missing?''\n\n''Does anybody here employ the above strategies and to what extent?''\n\n''What are your opinions on which platforms are the most secure?

Artists in particular have struggled to earn rewards if their work appreciates in value. NFTs can be coded to allow the original creator to collect money each time the token move hands.\n\nNFTs can return the power and control back into the hands of the artists!\n\nWhy NFTs are so expensive?\n\nLike any asset or coin, supply and demand are driving the price. Due to the scarce nature of NFTs and the high demand for them people are often prepared to pay a lot of money for them.\n\nAlso, a lot of people see those NFTs as an investment opportunity, they can resell the NFT they bought for higher price.\n\nNFTs markets\n\nThose are the most knowns marketplaces for NFTs where you can buy and sell NFTs that represent all the things I mentioned above.\n\n[Nifty Gateway](https://niftygateway.com/)\n\n[OpenSea](https://opensea.io/)\n\n[Rarible](https://rarible.com/)\n\n[Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/)\n\n**P.S.**\n\nI believe that the NTF market is something that the crypto world would see grow rapidly in the next months, more and more projects starting to pop up and artists starting to sell their art/music using the technology.\n\nThis technology can really affect for good a lot of industries and can change things for the better.\n\nShould be flair as educational.\n\nIf you have anything to add feel free to write in the comments and I'll add it to the post.\n\nI'm not a native English speaker so sorry for any grammar/spelling mistakes.\n\nSources:\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2021/02/26/what-is-an-nft-and-should-you-buy-one/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2021/02/26/what-is-an-nft-and-should-you-buy-one/)\n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/what-are-nfts](https://www.coindesk.com/what-are-nfts)\n\n[https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/what-does-nft-mean-crytpo-non-fungible-tokens-art-explained-2021-2-1030120067](https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/what-does-nft-mean-crytpo-non-fungible-tokens-art-explained-2021-2-1030120067)"}, {"title": "The illegal naked shorts of Gamestop might cause a second 2008 reaction towards crypto", "score": 23, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/myf8g5/the_illegal_naked_shorts_of_gamestop_might_cause/", "selftext": "I follow r/superstonk closely and I believe wall street's activities in this stock will continue to uncover the illegal doing of the hedge funds.

Unfortunately, it had a rather limited selection of coins--Bitcoin, Ethereum, BCH, DAI, LTC, maybe a couple of others. I didn't want to use anything with crazy fees, but luckily I had some LTC sitting on a wallet. The fee was less than 1 cent, it took about 60 seconds to send and 5 minutes to confirm. All together, it was a very straightforward process and worked about as well as I could hope e-commerce could. \n  \nMy takeaway from this is that a) I am starting to see mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies for transactional purposes by merchants, and b) the network effect provides an edge to older altcoins like Litecoin. Something I've said in threads here before: there are coins that are faster and cheaper to use, like XLM and Nano, but the longevity and security of LTC and BCH, combined with far cheaper transactions compared with BTC and ETH, may make them attractive to mainstream merchants looking for simple, reliable ways to integrate crypto. \n  \nTL;DR: I bought a razor online with Litecoin.

You get 1/3 of the reward instantly and the other 2/3 vest in 6 months. [Full list of rewards here](https://analytics.sushi.com/).\n\nAnyways after 1.5 months of farming, yesterday the gas fees were low, so I finally harvested my SUSHI. In total, I got almost $7,000 USD worth of SUSHI and still have another 2/3 locked up. I am planning on holding because SUSHI is currently like $11, but if SUSHI price goes back up to the ATH of $22, then my $6k will be worth $12k. Regardless it is awesome that you can get legit income from holding crypto assets.\n\nIf you aren't staking your assets, you are really missing out. I'm my opinion, Sushiswap is the best platform for this because they give additional rewards as compared to Uniswap. Also SUSHI now supports Matic and BSC chains (so transactions now cost pennies compared to normal ETH fees). Sushi also just launched [BentoBox lending via Kashi](https://app.sushi.com/bento/kashi/borrow) (which is basically AAVE), so you can now also use SUSHI or other cryptos as collateral to lend or borrow directly on the platform.

People just scan and send?\n\nWhat about transaction times and fees?

That's why I hold most top 10 cryptocurrency's and invest a small portion of my portfolio in low market cap gems (+- 25% with max 5% per coin).   \n\n\nA while ago I stumbled upon Utrust, UTK. In my opinion a cryptocurrency with great potential. It wants to solve the \"problem\" with paying in cryptocurrency at a webshop (e-commerce wide). The webshop can get paid in fiat, while the customer can pay with cryptocurrency that is partnered with UTK.   \n\n\nLet me quote the use case. (copied from coinmarketcap.com \n\n>One of the most severe problems of cryptocurrency is price volatility. Utrust aims to protect both buyers and sellers from its effects by shielding the sellers against market volatility and providing the buyers with a refund option.  \n>  \n>Until a purchased product is received by the buyer, Utrust secures the transaction, acting as a mediator and ensuring the success of the transaction.\n\nSo it looks like a Paypal competitor, with more integration for Crypto.\n\nCryptocurrency users tend to make use of more than one wallet and exchange for managing their crypto assets. Utrust aims to reduce this complexity by introducing its own native wallet that allows users to make fast and secure transactions. This mobile wallet supports both on- and off-chain payments. Furthermore, it allows users to convert cryptocurrencies to [fiat](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/fiat) to help offset price volatility.\n\nAnd let's be honest, all employees wish to get paid in FIAT, pay rent in FIAT, and do most of your grocery shopping in FIAT. I don't think FIAT will go away anytime soon, and I think UTK can be a key player in the 2 currency's living side by side.   \n\n\nLet's look at the pros: \n\n* UTK has a good team, with all \"real\" employees who have had careers at other cryptocurrency's. One of the co-founders has worked at, Uphold, AT&T and Airtel. \n* They are active on social media and are announcing new partnerships regularly. \n* They have a real use case, which may solve problems with paying in crypto. \n* And now the biggest one. It has a market cap of just 200 million with a 90% of the coins already circulating. \n* Its ATH is from 2018 and was 1,20$, the coin is now selling for 0,41$\n* The coin is yet to be announced on coinbase, but is already on coinbase for institutes, which suggests that it can be added in a short term. \n\nThe negatives:   \n\n\n* It's based on the ethereum protocol. So, at least for now it has high gasfee's which may prevent it from mass adaption in the short term. \n* With Paypal and Venmo already show some progression in their adoption for crypto, they may become unneeded.   \n\n\nPlease, if I have missed anything, or am completely wrong on some points let me know! And let me know what your thoughts are on this potential gem!"}, {"title": "Why does everyone seem SO convinced there is going to be another crazy bear market with ridiculous drops similar to the past?", "score": 11, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/myb1qq/why_does_everyone_seem_so_convinced_there_is/", "selftext": "I\u2019m thinking specifically mostly about Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Using one of my favourite crypto subreddits I did a poll to gauge the probable gender split of crypto currency investors.**\n\nWith a sample size of 244, within this subreddit I found only 16% of investors were female. Adjusting this statistic to better represent the general population (59% of redittors are male) I found that based on my sample size around 21.5% of all cryptocurrency investors are fem ale (a possible margin of +-5% error)\n\n# Women and risk aversion.\n\nThere are many studies that examine women and risk aversion. It is widely accepted that women are more risk adverse than men. This was found in studies observing male/female professional investors and also male/female professional tennis players. Experts however disagree over the reason behind this - whether this is primarily a biological trait or sculpted through societal forces. \n\nFor the purpose of this post the reason is actually not important. We know that women are more risk adverse, and this (along with a host of other factors) has kept a large cohort of women from investing in general, and in cryptocurrencies.\n\nOne particular study (Niederle & Versterlund 2007) concludes that when investing, women spend more time focussing on the possible costs, while men spend more time pondering the potential benefits. In addition they argue that men relate their past success to their innate abilities whilst women are more likely to relate past success to luck.\n\n**Whilst not fundamentally different, there is a distinct difference to the two difference perspectives.** \n\nFocusing on the possible downsides of an investment is far more likely to lead to a balanced view of an asset, but also avoids the possible pitfalls of confirmation bias. As the crypto market matures, there is a bigger need than ever before for investors who are proactively examining the possible downfall of an asset.\n\n# Men and the financial crisis\n\nThe traditional financial markets were built by men, mostly for men, and in 2008 collapsed by men in the financial crisis. This was by no means the first financial crisis but the largest of the 20/21st century. I won\u2019t go into the intricacies of the financial crisis but as we all know, people got way too greedy. Not nearly enough of wall street examined the possible downfalls of what they were doing. \n\nThe one thing that was certainly missing from Hedge Fund board rooms at the time was more women. Had there been women making the big decisions at hedge funds, it\u2019s possible there would never have been a financial crisis, due to the higher risk aversion of women. \n\nThose who refute this do so without any basis of fact. The reality is consistent: women have never had big enough influence on modern financial systems to change them for the better, so we will only know how differently they do things when they are sufficiently represented.\n\nRealising these implications puts into perspective why higher risk aversion isn\u2019t inherently a bad thing, but it does present a paradox. A high risk system benefits from risk adverse people, but risk adverse individuals are unlikely to participate in a high risk system.\n\n# The crypto revolution and women\n\nSo, from the ruins of 2008, a new currency, Bitcoin, along with a new set of ideals was born. A crypto economy without the need for regulation or fines. Since then a wild ride of innovation, market crashes and more has taken us all on a rollercoaster. But women are still on the fringes of the crypto-sphere. Volatility is cryptos worst enemy of widespread adoption. To avoid mistakes in the future we must look to past to make sure we don\u2019t make the same mistakes twice.\n\n**We\u2019ve already discussed that women are more risk adverse. What does this mean for crypto?**\n\nIf we take a mean average, female investors are more likely to only invest what they can lose. They also are more likely to do research and invest in projects with fundamental value - not meme tokens or joke currencies. They are more likely favour long term holding over day trading. But with only 21.5% of crypto investors being women, there are not enough women to have a big influence on stability and therefore adoption.\n\nI believe If 50% of cryptos investors were women, the price of Bitcoin, Ether, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and maybe a few more cryptocurrencies would stabilise more, as a more risk averse approach would lead to less volatility and in the long term, more gains for everyone.\n\n**What can we do to introduce women to crypto?**\n\nThis is the hardest thing to do and I hope one which people will share their own ideas about. Its clear more women in the crypto-sphere will benefit everyone, not least women themselves. Convincing anyone to invest in something is very risky, personally I have never done this, dare I be held responsible for any losses endured. \n\nMy approach is to introduce the core principles to the right female friends. Sending people this subreddit is also a very good start.\n\nI think that members of the crypto community have a duty to make cryptocurrency as truly gender equal as we can. Through this it will benefit us all, and make the world a better place."}, {"title": "Everyone is talking about how crypto made them rich...", "score": 298, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/myapwu/everyone_is_talking_about_how_crypto_made_them/", "selftext": "I recently joined this sub and everyday I see numerous posts saying how crypto made them rich etc. \n\nAnd then there's me, the noob who bought BTC 20 days ago when it was around 60k.

I saw that when I set up my wallet that I have an option to donate each month bath to creators?\n\nCould someone explain how this process of rewards go and if you have any more ways how to earn BAT with brave?\n\nThank you"}, {"title": "3 underestimated bull cases for ETH", "score": 49, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/my723b/3_underestimated_bull_cases_for_eth/", "selftext": "*10k ETH was never a meme*\n\n# EIP-1559\n\nWithout delving into technicals EIP-1559 will most likely make ETH a deflationary asset, which means the total supply will reduce with network use.\n\n[Estimates](https://twitter.com/drakefjustin/status/1382249926156021764) based on current utilization levels of the Ethereum network lead to a **\\~2% annual supply decrease (20k ETH burned everyday)**\n\nLearn more about EIP-1559 [here](https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/-eip-1559-hasu)\n\n# ETH 2\n\nNot even going to talk about the increasing amount of ETH locked in the deposit contract, or the incredible scaling which sharding provides.
